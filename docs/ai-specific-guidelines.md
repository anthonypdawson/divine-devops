## Additional AI-Specific Rules

1. **Automated Content Analysis**
   - Use AI tools to analyze the tone, style, and structure of posts to ensure they align with the project's guidelines.

2. **Error Detection**
   - Automatically check for missing or inconsistent fields in the front matter, broken links, or formatting issues.

3. **Batch Processing**
   - When making changes, process multiple posts or files in batches to ensure consistency across the project.

4. **Documentation Synchronization**
   - Ensure that any changes to guidelines or conventions are reflected in all relevant documentation files.

5. **Change Tracking**
   - Maintain a log of all AI-assisted changes for transparency and future reference.

6. **Avoid Overwriting Manual Edits**
   - Always check for recent manual edits to avoid overwriting contributors' work.

7. **Propose, Donâ€™t Enforce**
   - Suggest changes or improvements rather than enforcing them, leaving the final decision to human contributors.
