# Divine Incident Report

*Major outages or “miracles gone wrong” with full postmortem, logs, and lessons learned. Tone is dramatic, technical, and sometimes absurd.*

## Example Post Titles
- **incident-777:** The Great Flood (Rollback Attempt)
- **incident-888:** Babel Tower Outage

## Structure
- **Title:** Always `incident-###` for serial consistency.
- **Incident summary:** One-line summary of the event.
- **Logs:** Fenced code block with system or event logs.
- **Root cause:** Absurd, theological, or bureaucratic explanation.
- **Slack thread:** For team discussion.
- **Lessons learned:** Boxed section or bullet list.
- **Status:** `Resolved` / `Pending Divine Review` / `Let God Sort It Out`

## Special Conventions
- Use dramatic language and technical jargon.
- Lessons learned should be both serious and tongue-in-cheek.
