# Ask Uriel (Celestial Q&A)

*Uriel answers user-submitted questions with deadpan, unhelpful, or sarcastic responses. Tone is dry, dismissive, and often passive-aggressive. Not actually helpful.*

## Example Post Titles

- **ask-uriel-002:** How do I escalate a miracle request?
- **ask-uriel-003:** Is there a Service Level Agreement for divine intervention?

## Recommended Post Structure
- **Title:** Always `ask-uriel-###` for serial consistency.
- **Question:** The user’s question, written in-universe.
- **Uriel’s response:** Short, deadpan, and often unhelpful answer.
- **Status:** `Ignored` / `Escalated to Gabriel` / `Filed Under 'Not My Problem'`
- **(Optional) Slack thread:** For follow-up or team banter.

## Special Conventions
- Uriel’s voice should be dry, sarcastic, and slightly annoyed.
- Use blockquotes for Uriel’s commentary.
- Keep answers brief and in-character.
