# HR Announcements

*Posts related to HR topics, including onboarding, promotions, performance reviews, and humorous HR notes. Tone is celebratory, formal, and a bit tongue-in-cheek.*

## Example Post Titles
- **onboarding-angel-003:** Welcome, Raphael!
- **promotion-archangel-002:** Gabriel Promoted to Lead Messenger
- **performance-review-uriel-404:** Uriel's Annual Review

## Recommended Post Structure
- **Title:** Always `onboarding-angel-###`, `promotion-archangel-###`, or `performance-review-###` for serial consistency.
- **Announcement:** Welcome, promotion, or review message.
- **Checklist:** Onboarding, promotion, or review checklist (bulleted or checkbox list).
- **Slack thread:** For team welcomes, banter, or HR discussions.
- **Status:** `Onboarded` / `Promoted` / `Pending HR Review` / `Reviewed`

## Special Conventions
- Use HR-style language and playful bureaucracy.
- Include at least one humorous or absurd checklist or review item.
