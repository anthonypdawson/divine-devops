# Ask Me About My Uptime

*by Uriel-404, Probably Still Logged In*

Each post is a single war story—some catastrophic, some hilariously minor—told in classic incident log format, laced with Uriel’s signature deadpan commentary. The vibe is closer to a personal changelog or passive-aggressive postmortem than a Q&A. Think dry and petty, not helpful.

## Example Post Titles
- **uptime-001:** The Day Prayer Queues Overflowed
- **uptime-002:** Cloud-to-Ground Lightning Update Patch
- **uptime-003:** When a Prophet Hard-Rebooted Reality
- **uptime-004:** No One Backed Up Eden
- **uptime-005:** A Camel Triggered the Failover

## Structure
- **Title:** Always `uptime-###` for serial consistency.
- **Incident log:** Terminal-style report like the miracle posts.
- **Root cause:** Usually absurd, theological, or painfully bureaucratic.
- **Uriel’s comment:** Short, bitter summary or footnote.
- **Status:** `Resolved` / `Ignored` / `Filed Under 'Let God Sort It Out'`
