# HeavenOps Change Review

*Code or config change reviews by archangels, with in-universe comments and Slack thread. Tone is formal, sometimes exasperated, and full of divine bureaucracy.*

## Example Post Titles
- **change-review-042:** Deploying the New Commandments API
- **change-review-043:** Refactoring the Plague Delivery System

## Structure
- **Title:** Always `change-review-###` for serial consistency.
- **Change summary:** Brief description of the change.
- **Code diff/log:** Fenced code block with relevant changes.
- **Reviewer comments:** Blockquotes or commentary from archangels.
- **Slack thread:** For team discussion or banter.
- **Status:** `Approved` / `Needs Divine Intervention` / `Rejected`

## Special Conventions
- Use reviewer emails with on-theme domains (e.g., gabriel@archangels.eternal).
- Reviewer comments should be witty, formal, or bureaucratic.

## Post-Deployment Review
Analyze the impact of the changes after deployment.
