# Retrospective/Standup Log

*Team standup or retro logs, with each angel reporting blockers, progress, and divine interventions. Tone is informal, collaborative, and sometimes exasperated.*

## Example Post Titles
- **retro-2025-06-05:** Weekly Standup
- **retro-2025-06-12:** Incident Review

## Structure
- **Title:** Always `retro-YYYY-MM-DD` for serial consistency.
- **Date:** Date of the standup or retro.
- **Team member updates:** Each angel’s update (block or bullet list).
- **Action items:** Bullet list of follow-ups.
- **Uriel’s summary:** Blockquote with Uriel’s take on the meeting.
- **Status:** `Action Items Assigned` / `Pending Divine Review`

## Special Conventions
- Use a mix of technical and in-universe language.
- Uriel’s summary should be dry and/or critical.
