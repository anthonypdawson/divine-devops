# Divine RFC (Request for Comment)

*Proposals for new features, miracles, or policy changes, with comments from the celestial team. Tone is formal, technical, and sometimes absurd.*

## Example Post Titles
- **rfc-101:** Proposal to Automate Plague Delivery
- **rfc-102:** New Miracle Approval Workflow

## Structure
- **Title:** Always `rfc-###` for serial consistency.
- **Proposal:** Description of the proposed change or feature.
- **Rationale:** Why this change is needed (in-universe logic).
- **Slack thread:** For team discussion and comments.
- **Voting/outcome:** Decision or next steps.
- **Status:** `Accepted` / `Rejected` / `Pending Divine Review`

## Special Conventions
- Use technical and bureaucratic language.
- Comments should be in-character and humorous where possible.
