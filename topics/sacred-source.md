Sacred Source is where the divine meets the technical. This category is dedicated to showcasing source code that powers celestial operations, from apocalyptic scripts to divine debugging tools.


### Suggested Post Outline

While not required, posts in the Sacred Source category may follow this structure:

1. **Introduction**: Briefly describe the purpose of the code and its divine or celestial context.
2. **Code Excerpt**: Include the main source code snippet or script, annotated with comments explaining its functionality.
3. **Execution Logs**: Provide example outputs or logs generated by the code to illustrate its behavior.
4. **Lessons Learned**: Highlight any divine insights or technical challenges encountered during development.
5. **Future Enhancements**: Suggest potential improvements or extensions to the code.
