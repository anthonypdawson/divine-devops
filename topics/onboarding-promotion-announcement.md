# Onboarding/Promotion Announcement

*Welcome or promotion posts for new “angels” or contributors, with onboarding checklists and humorous HR notes. Tone is celebratory, formal, and a bit tongue-in-cheek.*

## Example Post Titles
- **onboarding-angel-003:** Welcome, Raphael!
- **promotion-archangel-002:** Gabriel Promoted to Lead Messenger

## Structure
- **Title:** Always `onboarding-angel-###` or `promotion-archangel-###` for serial consistency.
- **Announcement:** Welcome or promotion message.
- **Checklist:** Onboarding or promotion checklist (bulleted or checkbox list).
- **Slack thread:** For team welcomes or banter.
- **Status:** `Onboarded` / `Promoted` / `Pending HR Review`

## Special Conventions
- Use HR-style language and playful bureaucracy.
- Include at least one humorous or absurd checklist item.
