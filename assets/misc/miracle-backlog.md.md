## Backlog Grooming Workflow

1. **Daily Standup:** Gabriel reviews the queue for miracles with expired SLAs.
2. **Faith Quota Check:** Automated script adjusts priorities based on current faith reserves.
3. **Compliance Sweep:** Uriel audits for heretical or duplicate requests.
4. **Deployment:** Approved miracles are moved to the active pipeline for divine intervention.
