**INCIDENT ID:** #CREATION-000-LOOP  
**SEVERITY:** Critical  
**STATUS:** Resolved  
**REPORTED BY:** Uriel  
**AFFECTED SYSTEM:** `ethereal-registry`  
**TRIGGER FILE:** `creation-loop.js`

---

### **[Recursive Creation Detected]**

At 09:09 UTC, an improperly tested recursive function was pushed to the `creation` branch, leading to a **never-ending creation loop** that overran the celestial registry..

---

### **[Excerpted Code - `creation-loop.js`]**
```js
function createEternal() {
  var creationState = { status: "pending", iterations: 0 };
  
  // Recursive creation loop
  function recursiveCreation() {
    if (creationState.iterations < 1000000) {
      creationState.iterations++;
      log(`Creation cycle ${creationState.iterations}: Godmode enabled.`);
      
      try {
        // Unconditional recursive call
        recursiveCreation();
      } catch (e) {
        // Safe handling of recursion limit
        if (e instanceof RangeError) {
          log("Max recursion depth reached.");
        }
      }
    }
  }

  recursiveCreation();
  creationState.status = "complete"; // Never reaches here
  return creationState;
}
```
---

### **[Sample Log Output]**
```log
Creation cycle 999998: Godmode enabled. 
Creation cycle 999999: Godmode enabled. 
Creation cycle 1000000: Godmode enabled. 
RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded. Max recursion depth reached
```
---

### **[Incident Analysis]**

The recursion function was intended to continuously create divine entities, but instead caused an infinite loop. 

No check was placed on the number of recursive iterations, causing the system to attempt creation until memory exhaustion.

---

### **[Divine Commentary]**

**Uriel's Log Entry:**  
> *"This code was supposed to bring forth the eternal, not trap us in an endless loop of creation. The infinite recursion was like a snake consuming its own tail."*

**Gabriel's Slack Reply:**  
> *“We *cannot* keep creating more angels! We’re going to break the registry. Why is there no termination clause?”*

**Archival Note:**  
The function lacked termination checks. Without an upper bound on iterations, it entered an endless recursion, threatening the registry’s stability.

---

### **[Resolution]**
- **Rolled back** via divine rollback (`git revert --hex-blessing`)
- **Pruned** infinite loop from the system stack
- **Implemented** new branch, `creation-2.0`, with safe recursion limit

---

### **[Postmortem Actions]**

- All recursive functions reviewed and tested.
- Celestial recursion limits introduced with `eternal-stack.js`.
- New testing protocol set for `creation` functions under controlled divine recursion environments.
