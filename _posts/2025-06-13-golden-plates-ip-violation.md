## Lessons Learned

-   All prophecy extraction tools must require multi-factor celestial authentication.
-   Deprecated CLI utilities (e.g., seer-stone) are to be fully decommissioned.
-   Divine audit logs must be enforced for all access to messianic vaults.
-   Unauthorized forks will trigger immediate legal review and takedown procedures.
