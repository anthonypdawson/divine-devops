excerpt: 'The age-old debate between faith and works encountered within a pull request in the divine repository.'
summary: "A pull request in the divine repository sparks debate over the roles of faith and works in the salvation pipeline."

In the divine repository, the debate between faith and works has reached the pull request stage.

Here's how the team is handling the refactor...

<hr />
```
Pull Request: Refactor Salvation Logic
Author: Paul-dev
Branch: faith-solo-auth
```
> Streamlines salvation pipeline via faith. Removes legacy works-based checks.

James-dev:

> But what about:

```ts
// Pull Request: Refactor Salvation Logic
// Author: Paul-dev
// Branch: faith-solo-auth
// Streamlines salvation pipeline via faith. Removes legacy works-based checks.
if (faith && !works) {
    throw new Error('FaithWithoutWorksException');
}
```

Uriel-404:

> Faith works in staging. Prod expects both. Merge doctrine.json first.

System Bot:

> Tests failed:
>
> -   test_faith_alone_passes()
> -   test_faith_without_works_crashes()

Jesus (codeOwner):

> "Love one another. That should cover it."

In the end, the pull request was merged with a hotfix from Jesus, ensuring that love remains the ultimate dependency.
