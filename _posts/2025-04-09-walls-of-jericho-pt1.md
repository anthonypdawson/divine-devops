Hey, anyone else seeing the Jericho perimeter breach in the logs?

Seraphina [08:42]
Confirmed. Trumpet triggers fired prematurely. Looks like a false positive.

Uriel-404  [08:43]
Joshua’s automation again?

Seraphina [08:43]
He’s still using the legacy HornOfJericho.js script… with no debounce.

Uriel-404  [08:44]
Classic. How many walls down?

Seraphina [08:44]
Six so far. Seventh is teetering.

Uriel-404  [08:45]
Patch deployed. Rolled back the blast wave via miracle rollback protocol.

Seraphina [08:46]
Residents are... confused. One guy thought the rapture started early.

Uriel-404  [08:47]
Great. Looping in PR.

“Another day in divine ops.”
