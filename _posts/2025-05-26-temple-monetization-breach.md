## GitHub Issue: `#777` – Temple Monetization Breach  
**Opened by:** `jesus@messiah.dev`  
**Labels:** `security`, `compliance`, `sacred-integrity`, `audit`

---

### Description

Financial vendors detected operating inside `/temple/courtyard/`.  
Unauthorized APIs discovered including:

- `sacrifice-token.vendingService`
- `doveNFT.saleBot`
- `shekel-exchange-fraudEngine`

Courtyard no longer passing holiness audit. Violates sacred container policy.

---

### Steps to Reproduce

```bash
cd /temple/courtyard/
npm run audit
```

Output:

```log
> Found 23 vulnerabilities (12 critical)
> Detected moneyLender.js
> Detected livestockKiosk.bundle
> Prayer latency increased by 1200%
```

---

### Expected Behavior

Courtyard should be reserved for prayer, reflection, and prophecy queueing.

---

### Actual Behavior

- Merchants yelling over prayer traffic
- Sacrifice queue backlogged
- Foreign exchange services emitting spam
