Running late. Had an ops sync... unrelated.

**thomas [18:15]**  
Is this the real final supper or is there a follow-up calendar hold?

**jesus [18:16]**  
This is the one. After this, I go into silent mode.

**john [18:17]**  
Can confirm... love the energy.

**jesus [18:18]**  
One of you is going to backstab the repo.

## 🍷 Notes from the Table

-   Bread broken: symbol replaced with sacramental shortcut.
-   Wine distributed: triggers `new-covenant()` middleware.
-   Judas left early. Logs show payout from `/temple/finance/`.
