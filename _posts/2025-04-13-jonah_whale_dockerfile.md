```
#prophecy-deployments

@GOD: Jonah, deploy to nineveh-prod now.

@Jonah: uhhhhh... can't. They're not gonna listen. Low uptime. No observability.

@GOD: Not a suggestion.

@Jonah: rerouting to tarshish-dev...

@SYSTEM: jonah.service overboard @ port 404

@WhaleContainer: Acquired. Running introspection scripts.

@Jonah: stuck in this container 3 days now... reevaluating life choices.

@SYSTEM: restart jonah.service --target nineveh-prod

@Jonah: Okay okay, I'm deploying. Geez.
