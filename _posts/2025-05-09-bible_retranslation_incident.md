The **Bible Retranslation Incident** highlights the challenges of maintaining a sacred text repository in a multiverse environment. 

Unauthorized commits, AI-generated scripture, and translator bribes have led to significant inconsistencies across regional Bible deployments.

# INCIDENT REPORT

**Timestamp:** `[REDACTED]`  
**Component:** `SacredTextRepo`  
**Severity:** `High`  
**Status:** `Under Investigation`

---

## DESCRIPTION

During a routine checksum audit of the `/scripture/main` repository, significant inconsistencies were detected across regional Bible deployments.

Diff analysis revealed over **2,000 unauthorized retranslations**, ranging from minor phrasing shifts  
(`"blessed"` → `"optimized"`) to complete theological rewrites  
(`"thou shalt not kill"` → `"thou shalt not rate-limit excessively"`).

The corruption appears to have originated from an **over-permissive merge policy** enacted during the "Great Linguistic Expansion Initiative" (circa Tower of Babel incident), compounded by millennia of ad-hoc localization practices.

---

## EVIDENCE

- `/heaven/repos/scripture/commits/bae5cafe`
- Merge Request: `quick-fix-psalm-23-emoji-edition`
- Merge Request: `quick-fix-genesis-flat-earth-edition` 
- Comment thread: Debate over `"Sabbath Mode"` vs `"Rest API Mode"`
- `/heaven/repos/scripture/commits/7f3b2e1c`  
  - Commit message: "Replaced 'manna' with 'gluten-free bread' for modern audiences."

  
---

## ROOT CAUSE

- Lack of enforced code review policies post-Babel
- Frequent human-initiated `pull miracles` bypassed canonical review queues
- Translator bribes detected (suspected loaves, fishes, and minor prophecies)

## COMMENTS

**URIEL-404** (Sr. Sysadmin):  
> "Looks like at least 40% of the New Testament was rewritten by freelance contractors.  
> Some commits are literally just memes."

**Gabriel** (DevOps Coordinator):  
> "Explains why there's a version out there where Jesus has a skateboard."

**AuditBot.v3:**  
> `WARNING: Found version tagged 'BibleGPT_beta'. AI-generated scripture detected.`

## ACTION ITEMS

- [x] Revert all non-authoritative commits to backup `Gospel_v1.0.33`
- [ ] Implement strict divine merge request approvals
- [ ] Launch retranslation audit across multiverse branches
- [ ] Apologize for denominations founded on autocorrect errors

---

## ADDITIONAL NOTES

- New `"Scripture Linting Tool"` under development.
- Proposal to **freeze `/scripture/main`** and allow forks only under **Archangel supervision**.
