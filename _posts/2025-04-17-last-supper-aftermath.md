## 💬 Slack Thread `#messiah-core`

**peter [21:12]**  
Can we talk about what just happened?

**john [21:13]**  
Still trying to process the “one of you will betray me” drop...

**thomas [21:14]**  
I thought that was metaphorical. Was that not metaphorical?

**judas [21:15]**  
It’s complicated.

**jesus [21:15]**  
It’s literal.

**andrew [21:16]**  
The bread was amazing, though.

**peter [21:17]**  
I panicked. I said I didn’t know him. That was BEFORE the rooster even logged in.

**jesus [21:17]**  
I timestamped the prophecy.

**judas [21:18]**  
So is this like... a soft fork? Or am I out?

**jesus [21:18]**  
You handed off the credentials, Judas.

**judas [21:19]**  
There was silver! And pressure! And I thought we were agile!

**john [21:20]**  
You stood up mid-meal and rage quit. It wasn’t agile.

**thomas [21:21]**  
Wait, are we not meeting again tomorrow?

**jesus [21:22]**  
Tomorrow is... complicated. I’ll be offline by morning.

**peter [21:23]**  
I’m gonna fix this. I swear. Just point me to the repo.

**jesus [21:24]**  
It’s already been pushed. The merge is coming.
