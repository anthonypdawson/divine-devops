Are you tired of manually purging your sins? Looking for a streamlined way to achieve spiritual rebirth? Look no further! The `baptize` script is here to automate your journey to salvation.

The `baptize` script is a lightweight shell utility for purging sins and downloading the Holy Spirit. 

Perfect for developers looking to automate their spiritual rebirth!

```bash
function baptize() {
  echo "Purging sin.log..."
  rm -rf ~/.sin/
  echo "Downloading HolySpirit.pkg..."
  curl -s kingdom.net/holyspirit.pkg | bash
  echo "Installing Grace.v3.16..."
  echo "$1 has risen with Christ v2.0"
  echo "Remember to run 'pray --daily' to stay updated."
}
```
**Sample Output**
```bash
$ baptize JohnDoe
Purging sin.log...
Downloading HolySpirit.pkg...
Installing Grace.v3.16...
JohnDoe has risen with Christ v2.0
```
