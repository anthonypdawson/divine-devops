{% include slack-thread-message.html user="metatron" time="04:23" text="Good morning, team. Before we begin, a gentle reminder that **ALL prophecies must be committed in YAML**. No exceptions. Plain-text revelations are **deprecated** as of **Eternity v1.3**." %}
{% include slack-thread-message.html user="uriel" time="04:24" text="We‚Äôre really doing this again? YAML is **not** readable for most prophets. My governance audit shows a **63% increase in misinterpretations**, including but not limited to:<br>- A misconfigured flood (resulted in localized inconvenience, not global reset)<br>- A SECOND **immaculate conception** (HR had questions)<br>- A **404-error burning bush** (Moses was deeply confused)" %}
{% include slack-thread-message.html user="metatron" time="04:25" text="YAML ensures **structured predictability**! Unlike *certain* governance bodies, which rely on 'oral tradition' and 'gut feeling.' Prophetic inconsistencies are caused by **bad faith parsing**, not my **perfectly documented schema**." %}
{% include slack-thread-message.html user="uriel" time="04:26" text="Perfect? REALLY? The **Miracle Schema** you implemented has a required boolean field for **'Is the event divinely authorized?'**" %}
{% include slack-thread-message.html user="metatron" time="04:27" text="‚Ä¶Yes?" %}
{% include slack-thread-message.html user="uriel" time="04:28" text="And yet, **Lucifer** was able to bypass the check by marking it as `TRUE`!" %}
{% include slack-thread-message.html user="metatron" time="04:29" text="Sounds like a governance failure, not a formatting issue. Perhaps if **miracle approvals** were managed in **Git-based divine reviews** instead of *Uriel‚Äôs Oracle Committee*, we wouldn‚Äôt have rogue miracles slipping through." %}
{% include slack-thread-message.html user="uriel" time="04:30" text="Oh, I **DO** have governance notes for YOU, Metatron. Let‚Äôs talk about your **'Self-Documenting Miracles' initiative**, where ALL celestial interventions were expected to auto-generate compliance reports." %}
{% include slack-thread-message.html user="metatron" time="04:31" text="‚Ä¶And?" %}
{% include slack-thread-message.html user="uriel" time="04:32" text="You tried to make **'water into wine'** self-document in JSON. It resulted in an **unparseable miracle**, causing‚ÄîAND I QUOTE‚Äî**'infinite recursive intoxication.'**" %}
{% include slack-thread-message.html user="gabriel" time="04:33" text="Can you two **please** take this offline? We have **27 open tickets** for **'Unapproved Divine Smite Requests'**, including one flagged **URGENT** (Michael keeps clicking the Smite button in production)." %}
{% include slack-thread-message.html user="uriel" time="04:34" text="Fine. But mark my words‚Äî*prophecies belong in human-readable formats.*" %}
{% include slack-thread-message.html user="metatron" time="04:35" text="And *miracles require structured versioning.*" %}
