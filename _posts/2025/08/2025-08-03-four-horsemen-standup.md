**Location:** ApocalypseOps Slack Channel
**Reported By:** HeavenOps SRE Team

## 📝 Standup Log

- **War ⚔️** “Merge conflict detected in every branch. All code reviews escalated to flame wars.”  
- **Famine 🍞** “Resource quotas exceeded. All containers starved. No memory, no disk, no hope.”  
- **Pestilence 🦠** “CI pipeline infected. Malware outbreak in every build. All tests now flake.”  
- **Death 💀** “Data loss event. `/dev/null` is now the only persistent volume. Decommissioning all legacy services.”

## 😱 Team Responses

- **Lead Dev:** "Can we roll back to before the horsemen joined?"
- **QA:** "Is there a test for the apocalypse?"
- **PM:** "Can we reschedule the end of the world for next sprint?"
- **Intern:** "Do I still get paid if the repo is gone?"

## 🛠️ Mitigation Steps

- Attempted to deploy empathy middleware. Failed: War blocked all PRs.
- Tried to scale up resources. Famine throttled all nodes.
- Ran antivirus. Pestilence disabled all security plugins.
- Restored from backup. Death deleted all snapshots.

## 📉 Impact & Lessons Learned

- Chaos engineering is not a substitute for actual chaos.
- Always check attendee list before inviting Horsemen to standup.
- Next time, enable "apocalypse mode" in incident response playbook.
