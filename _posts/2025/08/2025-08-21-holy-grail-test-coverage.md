### 📜 Description

<span class="dropcap">T</span>he legendary state of software quality — **100% test coverage** — stands as the unattainable summit of QA ambition. Not merely branch coverage. Not function coverage. We're talking divine, *all-seeing* coverage: every possible execution path, every improbable edge case, every race condition accounted for.

A test suite so pure it runs itself.

```
- No flakiness.  
- No skipped tests.  
- No TODOs.  
- No "we'll write this later."  
- No lies.
```

<span class="decorative">It is whispered in sacred CI/CD scrolls that such a suite once existed, blessed by Saint Linus and audited by the Ghost of Uncle Bob. All bugs fled before its gaze. All regressions were smitten on merge.</span>

But one day, a junior dev added `--force` to a deploy script.  
And the Grail was lost.

### 📉 Incident Reference: `QA-666-HOPE-FRAGMENTED`

> Developer claimed 100% test coverage.  
> Audit revealed:
> - 46% backend (mostly DTOs)  
> - 12% frontend (deprecated React)  
> - Multiple `"// TODO: write tests"` left uncommented in commit logs  
> - Test suite had been failing for 6 days; CI notifications muted via Slack filters

### 🧾 Notes from Uriel-404:

```
[QA_LOG] URIEL-404:

Ah, yes. 100% coverage.
The last time someone claimed that, we found three null pointer exceptions and a dead cat in their microservice.

You want perfect tests? Write perfect code.
You want to sleep at night? Learn to live with doubt.
```

### 🛐 DevOps Theology

In some sects, 100% test coverage is viewed as heretical — a false idol distracting from real faith: **meaningful coverage**.  
Others pursue it as penance. A self-flagellating ritual to atone for shipping bugs to prod.

And then there are the Purists — who claim that if your test suite is not self-aware and capable of self-repair, it's unclean.

Let us pray for their CI pipelines.

---

### ⚠️ Warning

Pursuing the Holy Grail of 100% test coverage may result in:   
```
- Endless refactoring quests
- The summoning of ancient bugs
- Loss of sanity points
- CI/CD pipeline purgatory
- The wrath of the QA Templars
```
Proceed only if you possess the Sacred Linter and the patience of a thousand code reviewers.

---

## TL;DR
- 100 % line coverage ≠ bug‑free code.
- The only thing 100% coverage guarantees is a longer build time.
- Don’t worship the coverage idol—pray for bug-free deploys instead.
- Focus on critical paths—the road to deployment heaven, not the detour through the Valley of Deprecated Functions.

### 🏆 Moral

<span class="decorative">The true Grail is not perfect coverage, but the wisdom to know when enough is enough—and the courage to merge anyway.</span>

---

**Status**: <span class="decorative">Still lost.</span>  
**Recommendation**: <span class="decorative">Write fewer tests. But write real ones.</span>
