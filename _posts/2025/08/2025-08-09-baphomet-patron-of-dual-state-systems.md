## 🐐 Baphomet — Patron of Dual-State Systems

- **Origin**: Occult symbology, balance and contradiction  
- **Debugging Domain**: Schrödinger’s bugs, race conditions, dual-state variables  
- **Shrine**: Git repo with two conflicting branches that *both* pass CI

**URIEL-404 INTERNAL MEMO**  
_Subject: Invocation Audit — Entity: BAPHOMET_

> _“Oh good, another ‘both states are valid’ scenario. Must be Tuesday.”_  
>  
> Engineers keep invoking Baphomet to "bless" race conditions instead of fixing them.  
> Reminder: simultaneous truths are not valid patch logic.  
>  
> Artifact trail includes:
> - `.env.production` defines `ENABLE_SHADOW_MODE=true`  
> - `.env.local` overrides with `false`, CI says both are fine  
> - Merge strategy: *“Whichever branch answers first wins”*  
>  
> I wash my hands of this paradox. Again.

**Shrine Location:**  
```
📁 /srv/git/baphometShrine
├── branch-a/ ✅ CI passed

## 🛠️ Mitigation Steps

- Audit all environment variable sources for shadow mode toggles.
- Refactor merge strategies to require single-source-of-truth validation.
- Add race condition detection to CI pipeline.
- Document paradoxes in README.md for future engineers.
- When in doubt, consult Uriel-404 before invoking Baphomet.

## 🐛 Race Condition Reproduction Steps

```python
# Schrödinger's Bug: Both states are true, neither is false
import threading
state = {'truth': None}
def set_true():
	state['truth'] = True
def set_false():
	state['truth'] = False
t1 = threading.Thread(target=set_true)
t2 = threading.Thread(target=set_false)
t1.start(); t2.start(); t1.join(); t2.join()
print("Both states executed. Final truth:", state['truth'])
# Output: Final truth is negotiable. Consult Baphomet.
```

## 🤖 CI Pipeline Output
```
branch-a: tests passed
branch-b: tests passed
Warning: Baphomet blessing detected. All tests now pass and fail simultaneously.
Result: CI status = "Schrödinger's Success"
```

## ✅ Baphomet Compliance Checklist
- [x] Both branches pass CI
- [x] Merge strategy: "Whichever branch answers first wins"
- [x] Reality is negotiable
- [x] Dev prayer offered
- [ ] Consulted Uriel-404 (optional)

🧠 _Fun Fact:_ Baphomet is also rumored to manifest during stale state updates in React hooks.  
But that might be another daemon.
