### 🧠 Uriel-404 Response

> This is why we don’t let interns run `sudo apt upgrade` during a blood moon.

> Also, `/usr/share/madness/README.md` is *not* a valid onboarding document.

> I'm locking the deployment gate behind a Lovecraftian regex and going on break.

#### 🕯️ Eldritch Aftermath

> The deployment logs began to pulse with unreadable glyphs. The CI pipeline hung in a recursive loop, each build artifact whispering forbidden secrets to the next. Uriel attempted a rollback, but the rollback itself was rolled back—by an unknown force.
>
> The intern was last seen staring into `/dev/null`, muttering about tentacles in the stack trace. The monitoring dashboard now displays only a single metric: "SANITY: 0%".
>
> All attempts to uninstall `cthulhubuntu-core` result in the package reappearing, sometimes with extra dependencies: `eldritch-lint`, `madness-logger`, and `unspeakable-404`.
