# 🕉️ OmCloud™: Sync Your Karma Across Lifetimes

Welcome to **OmCloud™**, the first metaphysical storage platform that transcends time, ego, and local disk space.

---

## 🌐 Features

- **Startup Sound:**  
  A low-frequency chant that harmonizes your chakras and clears your cache.

- **Reincarnation Sync:**  
  Automatically backs up your soul-state every 108 breaths.  
  _No more losing progress between incarnations._

- **Karmic Encryption:**  
  Your deeds are hashed using divine salt—accessible only via mantra-based authentication.

- **UI/UX Design:**  
  Minimalist, circular, and impossible to navigate without achieving enlightenment.

- **Supported File Types:**  
  `.aura`, `.mantra`, `.pastlife`, `.moksha`

---

## 💸 Pricing Tiers

- **Free:** 1 reincarnation cycle per user. Ads may appear in dreams.  
- **Pro:** Unlimited lifetimes + priority rebirth queue.  
- **Enterprise Karma:** Dedicated guru, 24/7 mantra support, and distributed nirvana.
