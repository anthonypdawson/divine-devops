intro: "An annotated field report from the Dantean Migration Bureau, guiding a junior engineer through the nine circles of release suffering—where deprecated APIs whisper, merge conflicts spin, and Lucifork eternally chews conflicting branches."

When the last build failed under a crimson moon, I was summoned to guide a junior engineer—wide-eyed and credentialed—through the Circles. Our mission: trace the fate of projects trapped in perpetual release.

---

## Circle I — The Limbo of Deprecated APIs
*Field Note Severity: Low (ambient latency of decay)*  

Gentle groans of legacy endpoints echo here. No malice, only the eternal boredom of methods called but never returned.  
**Daemon on duty:** *Custodian GET*, sipping tea that never cools.  
*Legacy isn’t loud; it erodes expectations molecule by molecule.*

---

## Circle II — The Whirlwind of Conflicting Merge Requests
*Field Note Severity: High (kinetic merge turbulence)*  

Here, developers are hurled endlessly through rebases, their branches forever one commit out of sync.  
**Judgement script:** [Merge-Conflictus.sh](/assets/misc/Merge-Conflictus.sh#content), which tags PRs with a crimson ❌ upon arrival.  
*Rebase is the centripetal force that keeps despair in orbit.*

---

## Circle III — The Slush Pile of Incomplete Documentation
*Field Note Severity: Medium (progressive cognitive frostbite)*  

Snow drifts made of TODO comments. Annotations without bodies. The cold bites deepest where the wiki ends mid-sentence.  
*Silence scales; missing context compounds like unpaid interest.*

---

## Circle IV — The Hoarders & Squashers
*Field Note Severity: Medium (history integrity erosion)*  

One daemon clutches every commit, never pushing. Another compresses all history into a single, unintelligible line. They glare at each other for eternity.  
*One worships opacity; the other worships amnesia.*

---

## Circle V — The Swamp of Passive-Aggressive Code Review
*Field Note Severity: High (morale toxicity)*  

Viscous with “nit:” comments and vague emojis. Here, daemons debate brace style until the stars go out.  
*Nothing decomposes faster than intent eclipsed by perpetual “nit:”.*

---

## Circle VI — The Firewall of Forbidden Ports
*Field Note Severity: High (network isolation & silent failure)*  

Past this lies only silence: inbound packets drop without reply. Port 6666 leads nowhere but a spinning loader icon.  
*Latency is merciful; absolute silence is theological.*

---

## Circle VII — The Loop of Abandoned Test Suites
*Field Note Severity: Critical (test signal rot)*  

Endless reruns of failing tests, untouched since the day they were written. Logs pile waist-deep; no one dares grep them.  
*Entropy here is line-buffered.*

---

## Circle VIII — The API Gateway of Fraudulent Microservices
*Field Note Severity: High (data trust collapse)*  

Each claims to serve data—each responds with lorem ipsum in disguise.  
*Observability dashboards flash green; truth returns 200 (fiction).*

---

## Circle IX — The Frozen Ticket Queue
*Field Note Severity: Existential (process stasis)*  

Here at the core, deep in Jira’s glacial heart, tickets lie trapped beneath ice so ancient their reporters have left the company.  
At the center squats *Lucifork*, a daemon with three heads, eternally merging the same pull request in three conflicting branches.  
*Stasis is the most scalable failure mode.*

---

### Egress Procedure
To ascend, we had to deploy a hotfix directly to Production—no staging, no review—while staring into Lucifork’s three sets of eyes.  
The changelog wrote itself in fire.

### Reflection
In the end none of it was supernatural: unattended process debt had simply fossilized into liturgy. Hell wasn’t the tooling—it was neglect given enough sprints to stratify.
