## 📦 Onboarding Pipeline

The body exhales the last of its runtime. A process exits with `status code 0` (graceful).     

Something light and stubborn peels free and drifts up into a queue that hums like refrigerated air. It's not a hallway; it's a manifest. The soul hovers, then snaps to a lane marked:

`🕊️ soul-queue.yaml`

A chorus of automation spins up. A cherubic runner (x64, spot instance) boots beside the queue with a clipboard UI none of the living would approve in a design review. The runner smiles anyway.

> "Welcome to Afterlife 2.0," it says. "We lint first."

The soul does not argue. It has nothing left to carry except questions and a faint impression of its last password.

```yaml
pipeline:
  name: onboarding
  steps:
    - id: lint
      run: grace-lint --threshold 0.90
    - id: attest
      run: haloctl attest --input soul.bundle
    - id: classify
      run: choir classify --ruleset seraphim.v4
```
---
Lint passes with a cheerful chime.

```
grace-lint v3.2.1
score: 0.94
notes: minor impurity drift (accepted), unresolved regret pointer (quarantined)
result: PASS
```
---
The queue advances the object one slot forward. A Seraph appears, feathers rendered like sunlight through a terminal, eyes like well-tuned log filters. The Seraph reviews a diff that looks suspiciously like a `.env` file.

```env
# soul.env
baptized=false
confessed=false
mercy_override=auto
debt_ledger=carried
```

The Seraph does not frown; Seraphim are *immune to UX*. Instead, a gloved finger taps the policy gate.

> "Pre-Approval Limbo," they announce, in a voice that sounds like a successfully applied migration. "Queue discipline maintained."

The soul is labeled `PENDING` in small, kind typography and redirected down a gentle slide into a room full of other labels that read `PENDING`. It's very quiet there, and oddly well-lit.

### ⏳ Pre-Approval Limbo

Limbo is an *observability dream*. Giant dashboards display eternity's slow metrics:

- `repentance throughput`
- `appeal latency`
- `forgiveness cache hit ratio`

Everyone is given a tiny harp and an SLA. No one is sure which to practice.

An angelic bot rolls by on a cart labeled "Pastoral Care." It hands the soul a brochure: "So You've Been Deferred by Policy Gates." The soul reads the first line three times without understanding and then sits with that, which is the point.

Somewhere above, someone merges something.

## 🔄 Deployment Delayed

Meanwhile, in the staging cloud where prayers are load-tested and faith is replayed deterministically, a daemon engineer named Verrine rushes into a standup late and caffeinated.

"Quick hotfix to `karmic.md`," they say, tying back a ribbon of smoke. "Just a wording change. Non-functional."

The choir of SREs share a look that in mortal shops means: famous last words.

```diff
diff --git a/docs/karmic.md b/docs/karmic.md
index 0f4ac14..b7d92a1 100644
--- a/docs/karmic.md
+++ b/docs/karmic.md
@@ Explain debt accrual window
- Debts are reconciled nightly at midnight UTC.
+ Debts are reconciled continuously, subject to grace.

@@ On forgiveness semantics
- Forgiveness clears interest.
+ Forgiveness clears principal.
```

The pipeline, *obedient as ever*, rebuilds faith.

*And then the heavens cough.*

```

2025-08-24T08:07:42Z staging-heaven choir[orchestrator]: ERROR circuit open on grace -> predestination
```

The word `timeout` lands with the weight of ten thousand standups.

A meeting materializes, naturally. Angels argue retroactive predestination. One wants to roll back time; another points at the audit trail and mutters, "Time is append-only." Someone writes, "The past is immutable" on a whiteboard and immediately erases it because they don't like how it looks in this font.

The daemon engineer stares at the diff, then at the logs, then back at the diff. "It was only `docs`," they repeat, as if that ever meant anything in a living system.

### 🚑 Triage

- Impact: Absolution requests in staging return 504 (`Grace middleware timeout`).
- Scope: Staging only. Production unaffected (for now, knock on crystal).
- Suspected root cause: Semantic drift from "interest" to "principal" changed the theology ABI. The `grace-middleware` now resolves a deeper debt than the `mercy` service is willing to semaphore without quorum.
- Mitigation: Close the circuit. Revert the language. Breathe.

```sh
# operator console
choirctl circuit close grace->predestination --env staging
git revert HEAD  # "Forgiveness clears principal" -> "Forgiveness clears interest"
haloctl rollout restart grace-middleware --env staging
```

The restart hangs on a hymn nobody remembers how to sing.

Silence presses. Then a title card appears, the kind you only see when no decision is a decision:

"Afterlife 2.0 will be delayed indefinitely."

The room accepts this with professional dignity and a shared calendar invite titled "Retrospective / Lamentations." Someone brings pastries. Someone else writes a blameless postmortem that contains the word "mysterium" exactly once.

## 📜 Artifacts

Soul Queue Manifest:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Queue
metadata:
  name: soul-queue
spec:
  policyGates:
    - name: baptism
      required: false
    - name: confession
      required: false
  admissions:
    - name: grace-lint
      minScore: 0.90
```

Staging Error Excerpt:

```
ERROR: Grace middleware timeout
CAUSE: MercySemaphore contention under doctrinal cache miss
ACTION: Expand grace window OR downgrade forgiveness semantics
```

Hotfix Commit (annotated):

```
feat(docs): clarify reconciliation semantics

Changing "nightly" to "continuous" and expanding forgiveness from interest to principal.
This is fine. Everything is fine. (famous-last-words.txt)
```

## 📝 Lessons learned

- Documentation is executable when belief compiles from it.
- Predestination is not a feature flag; do not toggle in staging during business hours.
- Grace timeouts are people timeouts. Page compassion before you page ops.
