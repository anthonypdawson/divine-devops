### **Excerpt from Slack #non-celestial-status**

{% include slack-thread-message.html user="uriel" time="09:15" text="Anyone else seeing protocol forking?" %}
{% include slack-thread-message.html user="gabriel" time="09:16" text="Confirmed. Language packs multiplying." %}
{% include slack-thread-message.html user="uriel" time="09:17" text="Filing this under \"not my miracle.\"" %}
{% include slack-thread-end.html %}

**Impact:** All global communication systems reverted to emoji-only mode for 40 days.

---

### **Root Cause**  
Human language stack was hardcoded, no feature flags.  
God pushed `Confusion.v3` straight to prod—no rollback, no changelog, no QA signoff.

### **Uriel's Note**  
> "Next time, I'm setting up a CI pipeline for miracles. Or at least a linter."
