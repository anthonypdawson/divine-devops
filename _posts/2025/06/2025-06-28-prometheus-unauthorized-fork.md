**Review Thread**

**Hermes**: Are you *sure* about this, Prometheus?

**Prometheus**: Humanity needs fire. Devs are cold and debugging in the dark.

**Zeus** ⚡: You DARE violate the EULA? This module is divine property.  
Rejected. You have no authorization to modify core elements.

**Postmortem Summary**

- **Incident**: Prometheus initiated an unsanctioned commit from a forked repo containing critical core fire modules.
- **Warnings Ignored**: Hermes (dev relations) issued early warnings, but the PR went live for 0.02s.
- **Action Taken**: Zeus revoked write access and triggered Olympus CI’s punishment script.
- **Punishment**: The audit daemon reviews Prometheus’s actions once per solar cycle, accompanied by a relentless compliance vulture that pecks through commit history.

**Notes from Olympus Infra Team**

- 🔥 Fire module now restricted to `god-mode` builds only.
- 🛡️ New rule in `CODE_OF_HEAVEN.md`: “Thou shalt not share devfire with mortals.”
- 🪙 Prometheus still holds top karma on `/r/divine_devops` for most legendary commit.
- 🦅 Compliance vulture now integrated into Olympus CI as a permanent feature.
