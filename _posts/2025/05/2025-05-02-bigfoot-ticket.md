**TICKET #: #9938-LEGACY-ANOMALY**

> **SUMMARY:** Unidentified bipedal test entity still visible in Pacific Northwest.

---

**DEBUG LOG:**  
Bigfoot appears to be a deprecated prototype left over from early hominid rendering tests. Cataloged as `creature.dev.test.hominid_v0.3`.

**Uriel-404:**  
> “The original dev left a note: 
> 
> `// leave him be, he's cool.` 
> 
> So we did.”

**Gabriel:**  
> “We tried to delete him once. The system recompiled him from folklore.”

---

**RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:**  
- Move asset to `myth/encounters` namespace.  
- Rate-limit further sightings via blurry-photo filter.  
- Add to `EasterEggs.md`.

---

**STATUS:** Won’t fix. Sentimentally preserved.
