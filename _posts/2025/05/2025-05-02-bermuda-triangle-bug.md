**BUG REPORT: Oceanic Routing Node - Atlantic/33°N 71°W**

> **ISSUE:** Persistent teleportation, signal loss, and temporal desync.

---

**SUMMARY:**  
The Bermuda Triangle is a legacy debug zone marked `DO_NOT_TOUCH`. A junior angel commented out that warning during a cleanup script in 1702.

---

**LOG THREAD:**  
**Uriel-404:**  
> “That’s not a region, it’s a looped stack trace with ocean around it.”

**Raphael:**  
> “The last recovery team never clocked out. One of them’s now a weather pattern.”

---

**TEMP FIXES:**  
- Re-enabled cosmic boundary markers.  
- Decreased probability of aircraft spawning over affected region.  
- Escalated to Quantum Anomalies Taskforce.

---

**STATUS:** Triaged. Marked as “Unresolvable but fun.”
