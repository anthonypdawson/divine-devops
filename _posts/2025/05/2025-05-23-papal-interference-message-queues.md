**LOG ENTRY: 2025-05-02 10:03:44 UTC**  
**SOURCE:** Intercession Pipeline v2.9  
**PRIORITY:** SEV-2  

> **ALERT: External actor (User: pope_user) causing significant message queue delays.**

---

**INCIDENT SUMMARY:**  
The intercession system's pub/sub architecture is experiencing critical latency due to excessive **manual interception** of outbound requests by an external user known as **pope_user**. Despite lacking internal authorization, the user has set up a **self-hosted approval gate** using Outlook, parchment, and a wax seal.

---

**DETAILS:**  
- Approximately 4.2 million prayers flagged `URGENT` have been quarantined for "theological review".  
- The user continues forwarding YAML-formatted blessing requests to a physical inbox in Vatican City.  
- They have been observed annotating JSON logs with Latin margin notes.

---

**NOTABLE QUOTES:**  
**Uriel-404 [Sysadmin Angel]:**  
> “They’re like an unverified middleware extension that insists on liturgical validation.”

**Raphael [UX Prophet]:**  
> “Somebody tell them divine latency isn’t a feature.”

---

**REMEDIATION ACTIONS:**  
- Reconfigured queue rules to flag and bypass all traffic from `papal_filter™`.  
- Reassigned legacy `papal_override=true` condition to "deprecated".  
- Issued gentle but firm canonical warning: *"Thou Shalt Not Middleware Without Authorization."*

---

**STATUS:** Monitoring. Vatican IP throttled. Blessings rerouted via cloud-native saints.

---

**Uriel-404 Commentary:**  
> “This is why we don't give sudo to users who believe in infallibility.”
