**Welcome, newly incarnated DevOps Seraph!**  
Congratulations on your promotion from soulstream intern to full-stack celestial maintainer. This guide will prepare you for your new role within HeavenOps.

---

### Required Tools

-   **Wings** (minimum 2.5m span for CI/CD aerial lift)
-   **Celestial CLI** (`ccli` v∞.0.1) – comes pre-installed in your grace shell
-   **Grafana access token** – locate in the "Golden Scroll of Keys"
-   **Scrollcase** – fireproof, waterproof, heresy-resistant
-   **Incense-compatible 2FA token**

---

### Standard Duties

-   Maintain uptime across distributed reality nodes
-   Debug metaphysical anomalies across timelines
-   Monitor the SoulQueue for overflow incidents
-   Reroute unscheduled miracles to staging
-   Manage prayer throttling and cosmic backpressure

---

### Forbidden Actions

-   Do not attempt to @God in #general
-   Never deploy on Judgment Day (see Incident #Apoc-000)
-   Avoid shadow-deploying wrath modules without sign-off from Michael
-   No rebasing on the Main Branch of Creation

---

### Unwritten Rules

-   Flame-resistant robes are **recommended** for on-call rotations
-   Radiance must be toggled off when speaking with mortals
-   Uriel will not answer DMs—submit requests via form `Form-404B`
-   Grace is cached, not guaranteed. Do not rely on it in prod.

---

### Communication Channels

-   `#heavenops` – Main SRE channel
-   `#incident-response` – Ongoing smiting events
-   `#gabriel-alerts` – Noisy. Mute at will.
-   `#limbo-dev` – Where abandoned feature branches reside
-   `#holy-metrics` – Home of the dashboard you’ll never understand

---

### Badge Access Levels

-   **Level 0** – Choir Room, Cafeteria (Closed Sundays)
-   **Level 1** – Cloud of Witnesses (read-only)
-   **Level 2** – Prayer Routing Nodes
-   **Level 3** – Judgment Queue (write access requires seraphim clearance)
-   **Level ∞** – Uriel's Cave (access denied. forever.)

May your deployments be blessed, your logs readable, and your alerts... silent.
