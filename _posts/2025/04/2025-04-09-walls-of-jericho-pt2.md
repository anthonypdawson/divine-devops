Try not to panic..

**Michael [09:02]**  
Hey Uriel. We have a situation. The walls of Jericho just... fell.

**Uriel [09:03]**  
Were the trumpet filters still disabled?

**Michael [09:04]**  
They walked around the perimeter seven times, then blasted horns. Total structural collapse.

**Uriel [09:05]**  
_sigh_ That was in the CVE bulletin from the last millennium. Echo buffer overflow.

**Michael [09:06]**  
Can we roll back the infrastructure?

**Uriel [09:07]**  
Attempting restore from `Jericho.snapshot.1057.BC`...

**Uriel [09:08]**  
(10%) (27%) (53%) -- **ERROR:** Integrity Check Failed. Too Much Trumpet.

**Michael [09:09]**  
What's the fallback plan?

**Uriel [09:10]**  
Log it as 'divinely unsalvageable'. I'll file a cosmic CVE.

**Uriel [09:11]**  
`JerichoWall v3.2` was never designed for harmonic warfare.

**Michael [09:12]**  
We need a patch for future fortifications.

**Uriel [09:13]**  
I'll issue a hardening advisory. Deploy `AngelWall v4.0` with acoustic dampening runes.

**Michael [09:14]**  
You're the best, Uriel.

**Uriel [09:15]**  
I know.
