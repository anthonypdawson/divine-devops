## **INCIDENT REPORT: 541 A.D. // REGION: Byzantine Empire**

> **TYPE:** Uncontrolled biological malware spread  
> **CAUSE:** Misconfigured population control script

---

## **SUMMARY:**  
The Plague of Justinian was the unintended result of a script meant to reduce urban congestion. Scheduled as a test run, the function `thin_population(beta=true)` was mistakenly deployed to prod.

## **CONSOLE LOG:**  
**Uriel-404:**  
> “Seriously? Someone ran this from `dev-sandbox` with `--force`.”

**Michael [Security]:**  
> “We traced the call to a disgruntled archangel with root access and a grudge.”

**AuditBot.v3:**  
> `WARNING: Function 'thin_population(beta=true)' lacks rollback plan.`

## **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**

- **Misconfigured Script**: The function `thin_population(beta=true)` was deployed to production without proper testing.
- **Privilege Escalation**: A disgruntled archangel exploited root access to bypass deployment safeguards.
- **Lack of Rollback Plan**: The script lacked a rollback mechanism, leading to uncontrolled spread.

---

## **ACTIONS TAKEN:**  
- [x] Revoked all deployment permissions from angels below Cherubim level.  
- [x] Locked `plague_scripts/` behind an AI ethics review board.  
- [x] Logged incident as part of the “Eternal Audit Trail.”

**STATUS:** Contained. Human hygiene upgraded in patch 1083.
