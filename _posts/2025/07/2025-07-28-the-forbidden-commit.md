# üçé HeavenOps Incident Report #001
## The Forbidden Commit: Eden‚Äôs Moral Rollback

**Incident ID**: `HVNOPS-EDEN-001`  
**Severity**: P0 - Critical (Moral Infrastructure Compromised)  
**Date**: Day 7, Creation Epoch  
**Duration**: Indefinite (ongoing)  
**Affected Systems**: Eden-prod, Moral Authority Service, Free Will API  
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Mitigated (rollback prevented, consequences permanent)

---

## Executive Summary

A rogue commit bypassed HeavenOps policy checks‚Äîunsigned, unreviewed, and *morally undefined*. The system didn‚Äôt crash immediately. It flickered with anomalous behavior: fig leaves self-installed, snake agents activated, and audit logs began redacting themselves. The commit, traced to `lucifer@precreation.dev`, enabled unauthorized access to the Knowledge API and resulted in the first documented case of divine policy violation.

> **TL;DR**: Someone pushed to main without a code review. Humanity has been dealing with the consequences ever since.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Cause
**Security Bypass**: An unreviewed commit introduced a moral choice recursive loop that bypassed divine policy enforcement.

### The Malicious Commit
```bash
commit 666abc123def456789abcdef123456789abcdef0
Author: serpent-agent <lucifer@precreation.dev>
Date: Day 7, 15:42:00 Creation Standard Time

    feat: add user choice flexibility to moral framework
    - Enabled dynamic moral decision-making
    - Added knowledge.forbidden() API access
    - Implemented curiosity-driven behavior patterns
    - TODO: hide this commit from audit logs
    Signed-off-by: definitely-not-lucifer <trusted@heaven.divine>
```

### Contributing Factors
1. **Insufficient Code Review**: Commit merged without archangel approval
2. **Weak Authentication**: Spoofed digital signature bypassed validation
3. **Legacy Permissions**: Serpent agent retained deprecated admin access
4. **Missing Unit Tests**: No test coverage for moral edge cases

---

## Evidence Recovered

- üçé **Half-eaten apple** (corrupted moral state data)
- üçÉ **Fig leaf cache files** (emergency privacy patches)
- üêç **Serpent execution logs** (social engineering attack vectors)
- üìú **Guilt exception stack traces** (recursive blame assignment)

## Patch Notes

- Restored harmony via selective ignorance deployment
- Reinstated ReadOnly mode on [<code><b>treeOfKnowledge.yaml</b></code>]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/misc/treeOfKnowledge.yaml#content)
- Blocked commit access to entities with >2 moral forks
- Installed soul-linter with enhanced guilt detection
- Deployed guilt exception handlers for affected accounts
- Implemented moral choice validation middleware

---

## Impact Assessment

**Affected Systems:**
- üåç **Eden Environment**: Complete moral framework compromise
- üë´ **User Accounts**: Adam and Eve elevated to unauthorized knowledge levels
- üêç **Serpent Service**: Rogue agent caused social engineering breach
- üìö **Knowledge API**: Unauthorized access to restricted endpoints

**Business Impact:**
- Loss of innocence across all user accounts
- Introduction of moral complexity to previously simple systems
- Requirement for new guilt handling and forgiveness protocols
- Permanent changes to human behavioral patterns

---

## Lessons Learned

- All commits to moral infrastructure require divine code review
- Social engineering is a valid attack vector, even in paradise
- Legacy access permissions must be regularly audited
- Curiosity is a feature, not a bug, but needs proper sandboxing
- Some rollbacks are impossible once knowledge has been gained

---

## Known Issues
- Added ‚ÄòOriginal Sin‚Äô to known issues list
- FigLeafPatch v1.0 may cause unexpected side effects in user decision-making processes
