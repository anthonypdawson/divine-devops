# Divine Migration Suite

Ever tried to run a schema update on 7 billion souls simultaneously? Yeah, us too. That's why we built the **Divine Migration Suite** - because apparently "turning the other cheek" doesn't work when your database is corrupted by original sin.

## Overview

The Divine Migration Suite handles those awkward spiritual data transformations that your typical ETL pipeline just can't handle. Like when you need to migrate entire civilizations from "wrath of God" status to "blessed and highly favored" - we've got scripts for that.

**Warning**: These migrations have been tested extensively in Purgatory (our staging environment), but as always, backup your souls before running in production. The IT department learned this the hard way during the Great Flood incident.

## Core Migration Scripts

*Note: All scripts include comprehensive error handling because apparently even divine interventions can throw exceptions.*

```sql
-- migrate_hearts.sql ‚Äî The Great Heart Refactor v2.0
-- "Have you tried turning it off and on again?" - IT support to Ezekiel
-- Breaking change: Legacy stone hearts no longer supported

BEGIN TRANSACTION heart_migration;

-- Pre-flight checks (learned this from the Noah deployment)
IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM users WHERE faith_level > 0)
BEGIN
    ROLLBACK TRANSACTION;
    THROW 50001, 'Error: Insufficient faith for heart upgrade. Please install Faith‚Ñ¢ v1.0 or higher.', 1;
END

PRINT '‚ù§Ô∏è Applying heart migration (this may cause temporary chest pains)...';

-- Clean up legacy implementations
DELETE FROM hearts 
WHERE type = 'stony' 
AND user_id IN (SELECT user_id FROM users WHERE redeemed = TRUE);
-- ‚òùÔ∏è Don't worry, we're backing these up to the Museum of Spiritual Artifacts

-- Install new heart architecture  
INSERT INTO hearts (user_id, type, created_date, warranty_expires, love_capacity) 
SELECT user_id, 'flesh', GETDATE(), '9999-12-31', 'UNLIMITED'
FROM users WHERE redeemed = TRUE;

-- Apply divine-grade encryption (NSA-proof)
UPDATE hearts SET sealed_by_holy_spirit = TRUE WHERE type = 'flesh';

COMMIT TRANSACTION heart_migration;
PRINT '‚úÖ Heart migration complete! Users may experience increased empathy and random acts of kindness.';

-- resurrect_users.sql ‚Äî "Have you tried dying and coming back?"
-- Customer support's least favorite ticket type

BEGIN TRANSACTION resurrection_protocol;

PRINT '‚ö∞Ô∏è Initiating resurrection protocol (estimated time: 3 days)...';

-- Always backup before major life changes
SELECT * INTO dead_users_backup FROM dead_users;
-- Because explaining data loss to grieving relatives is awkward

-- The main event
INSERT INTO users (user_id, name, status, resurrection_date, subscription_type) 
SELECT user_id, name, 'resurrected', GETDATE(), 'ETERNAL_PREMIUM'
FROM dead_users 
WHERE payment_for_sin = 'complete';

-- Cleanup (Marie Kondo would be proud)
DELETE FROM dead_users WHERE user_id IN (
    SELECT user_id FROM users WHERE status = 'resurrected'
);

-- Grant premium permissions
UPDATE users SET permissions = 'eternal_life,walk_through_walls,fish_multiplication' 
WHERE status = 'resurrected';

COMMIT TRANSACTION resurrection_protocol;
PRINT 'üéâ Welcome back to the land of the living! Your free trial of death has expired.';

-- babel_patch.sql ‚Äî The Universal Translator‚Ñ¢
-- Finally fixing that intern's mistake from 4000 years ago

BEGIN TRANSACTION babel_hotfix;

PRINT 'üó£Ô∏è Installing Babel patch v2.0 (fixing communication since 2000 BC)...';

UPDATE speech 
SET lang = 'universal_tongue', 
    comprehension_level = 100,
    babel_corruption = FALSE,
    confusion_factor = 0
WHERE lang LIKE 'babel_%';

-- Add Google Translate integration
INSERT INTO translation_layer (from_lang, to_lang, active, accuracy) 
VALUES ('ALL', 'universal_tongue', 1, 100.0);

COMMIT TRANSACTION babel_hotfix;
PRINT '‚úÖ Babel patch applied! Tower building projects may now resume safely.';

-- forgive_debts.sql ‚Äî The Ultimate Debt Forgiveness Program
-- "Have you tried forgiving and forgetting?" - Customer Service

BEGIN TRANSACTION divine_debt_relief;

PRINT 'üí∞ Processing forgiveness cascade (this might take a moment)...';

-- The nuclear option for debt management
UPDATE accounts 
SET balance = 0, 
    forgiveness_applied = TRUE,
    forgiveness_date = GETDATE(),
    credit_score = 850  -- Everyone gets perfect credit
WHERE user_id IN (
    SELECT debtor_id FROM forgiveness_queue 
    WHERE forgiver_confirmed = TRUE
);

-- Log for the auditors (even heaven has compliance requirements)
INSERT INTO audit_log (action, user_id, details, timestamp, auditor_notes)
SELECT 'DEBT_OBLITERATED', user_id, 'Divine intervention applied', GETDATE(), 
       'User prayed the magic words correctly'
FROM accounts WHERE forgiveness_applied = TRUE;

COMMIT TRANSACTION divine_debt_relief;
PRINT 'üéä Debt forgiveness complete! Credit agencies hate this one simple trick.';
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

**Q: Migration failed with "Insufficient grace reserves"**  
A: Try increasing your infinite_grace_pool. If that doesn't work, contact your local prophet for a grace top-up.

**Q: Users are complaining about heart palpitations after migration**  
A: This is normal. The new flesh hearts are significantly more responsive than the old stone versions.

**Q: Babel patch caused everyone to speak in King James English**  
A: Known issue. Hotfix coming in v2.2. In the meantime, enjoy the formal language experience.

## Emergency Rollback Procedures

*"When divine interventions go horribly wrong, we've got your back(up)."*

In case of spiritual regression, theological exceptions, or that awkward moment when you accidentally grant `smite_enemies` permissions to everyone:

```sql
-- Emergency rollback (use with extreme caution)
EXEC restore_spiritual_state_from_backup 
    @backup_date = '2025-05-17 11:59:59',
    @preserve_grace_credits = TRUE,
    @notification_level = 'ARCHANGEL',
    @panic_mode = FALSE;  -- Set to TRUE only in apocalyptic scenarios
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning**: Rollback procedures should only be executed by authorized personnel with divine admin privileges. Unauthorized rollbacks may result in temporal paradoxes, confused prophets, or worse - having to explain to Management why paradise is offline again.

**Emergency Contacts**:
- **L1 Support**: Your local priest/rabbi/imam
- **L2 Support**: Regional prophet 
- **L3 Support**: Archangel Gabriel (gabriel@heaven.divine)
- **Nuclear Option**: Direct prayer to Management (response time: mysterious ways)

## Known Issues

### Critical Issues üö®
- **DIVINE-2024-001**: Resurrection script occasionally revives users in wrong time period (medieval knights appearing in modern data centers)
- **DIVINE-2024-007**: Heart migration may cause users to spontaneously break into song (Disney princess syndrome)

### Major Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **DIVINE-2023-156**: Babel patch sometimes translates everything into ancient Aramaic during peak hours
- **DIVINE-2023-203**: Debt forgiveness script has 0.01% chance of also forgiving unrelated parking tickets (feature or bug?)
- **DIVINE-2024-015**: Paradise restore occasionally includes dinosaurs from pre-backup era

### Minor Issues üìù
- **DIVINE-2024-042**: Users with `walk_on_water` permissions keep flooding the office bathroom
- **DIVINE-2024-038**: Fish multiplication feature activated by sneezing near seafood
- **DIVINE-2024-051**: Grace credits display in scientific notation for users with excessive good deeds
- **DIVINE-2023-299**: Heart encryption sometimes prevents users from feeling anything during tax season (may be working as intended)

### Workarounds Available üîß
- **Time Travel Fix**: Restart the universe (downtime: 6 days)
- **Song Issue**: Temporary mute function available in user preferences
- **Aramaic Translation**: Have Moses on standby for interpretation
- **Dinosaur Problem**: Relocate to Jurassic Park database instance

*For complete bug reports and workarounds, see our internal JIRA instance at heaven.atlassian.net (divine authentication required)*

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Right ‚úÖ
- Testing in Purgatory staging environment saved us from another "Great Flood" incident
- Automated rollbacks prevented the "Sodom and Gomorrah" deployment disaster
- Users love the new heart performance (no more cold, unfeeling database queries)

### What Could Be Better ü§î
- Need better communication during paradise downtime (angry prayer tickets are the worst)
- Monitor Red Sea pathway usage (last time we had a traffic jam of epic proportions)  
- Document faith requirements BEFORE migration (not after users complain)

### Next Sprint Planning üìã
1. Build a faith-level monitoring dashboard (with pretty charts)
2. Automate spiritual state change notifications (push notifications to prayer apps)
3. Add granular resurrection permissions (not everyone needs `walk_on_water` access)
4. Schedule regular grace_ledger backups (because infinity is hard to restore)
