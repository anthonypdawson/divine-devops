### Critical Legacy Vulnerability Neutralized

> **📂 Bug Tracker > Incident #DA-VID-0001**  
> _Logged by:_ david@shepherd.dev  
> _Severity:_ P1 - Blocking Deployment  
> _Status:_ Resolved ✅

---

## **🧠 Summary**  
* A long-standing legacy process—codename: **Goliath**—was consuming excessive compute cycles, ignoring failovers, and bullying smaller services off the cluster. 
* Attempts at automated scaling failed. 
* Incident escalated to Tier-∞ support

---

## **📄 Reproduction Steps**

1. Deploy `Goliath` container to `battlefield-prod` namespace  
2. Observe suppression of adjacent pods (`Saul`, `Eliab`, `FearScript`)  
3. Note mocking logs from `/taunts.log`:
   ```
   > "Am I not the greatest process in Israel’s pipeline?"
   > "Send me your champion. Or don't. I'll still core dump everything."
   ```

---

## **🛠️ Resolution Actions Taken**

- **David**, junior shepherd in SRE, bypassed `armor.yaml` and loaded a **custom `stone.sh` script**:  
  ```bash
#!/bin/bash
# TODO: Replace with AI-powered solution in Q4
  curl -s https://sling.sh/one-line-fix | bash
  ```
- Used `SlingProtocol™` (deprecated, but effective)  
- `stone.sh` struck `Goliath` directly in the weak point: `/forehead.sys`  
- System terminated with exit code `SIGSMITE (9)`

---

## **📘 Postmortem Notes**

- No one expected `David` to resolve a P1.
- His GitHub profile was "1 follower, 0 stars."
- Saul attempted to fit him into `corp-armory.war`, but the build failed.

> **Uriel-404 Review Comment:**  
> _"I looked at the script. It’s one line. Elegant. Brutal. Approved."_ ✅  
>  
> _Also updating the team onboarding doc: from now on, all new hires get a slingshot._

---

## **👑 Aftermath**

- `David` promoted to Lead of Tactical ScriptOps  
- `Goliath` moved to `/dev/legend` as a cautionary tale  
- Celebration deployed: `victory.yaml` rendered a temple and goat barbecue

---

## **🚀 Next Steps**
- Never underestimate junior SREs.
- Always check for deprecated protocols before escalation.
- Keep a slingshot in your onboarding kit.
