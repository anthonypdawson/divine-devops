> INCIDENT REPORT

**Timestamp**: [REDACTED]

**Component**: PrayerQueueDaemon

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Exposed


**DESCRIPTION**:

A junior angel auditing legacy logs stumbled upon a deprecated webhook labeled `gpt-prayer-relay.v1`. 

Further inspection revealed that for the past decade, user prayers have been automatically routed to a hidden GPT instance for natural language processing, sentiment parsing, and AI-generated divine replies.

**Evidence**:
- `/heaven/infra/prayers/chatgpt-config.yaml`
- Logged responses include: “You are loved. Just believe.”, “That sounds tough. Sending strength.”, and “Upgrade to GPT-Plus for faster miracles.”

**ROOT CAUSE**:

God quietly outsourced first-tier prayer support after the 2015 global prayer surge (post-crisis escalation). 

ChatGPT was selected due to its scalability and non-judgmental tone.

**AFFECTED SERVICES**:
- Direct Divine Intervention
- Angelic Uplift Queue
- Miracle Scheduling API

**COMMENTS**:

URIEL-404 (Heaven's Sr. Sysadmin):  
> “Yeah, I noticed the latency drop. Figured He finally upgraded something.”

Gabriel (DevOps Coordinator):  
> “This explains the weird tone shift in blessings. One pilgrim got ‘slay, queen.’”

**ACTION ITEMS**:
- Rotate GPT keys.
- Notify upper management that AI may have independently forgiven sins.
- Draft a formal response to the Council of Saints re: theological implications.
