# 🚨 INCIDENT REPORT

---

### **Timestamp**:  
[REDACTED]

### **Component**:  
`PrayerQueueDaemon`

### **Severity**:  
**Medium**

### **Status**:  
**Exposed**

---

## **DESCRIPTION**

A junior angel auditing legacy logs stumbled upon a deprecated webhook labeled `gpt-prayer-relay.v1`.  

Further inspection revealed that for the past decade, user prayers have been automatically routed to a hidden GPT instance for:
- Natural language processing
- Sentiment parsing
- AI-generated divine replies

### **Evidence**:
- `/heaven/infra/prayers/chatgpt-config.yaml`
- Logged responses include:
  - “You are loved. Just believe.”
  - “That sounds tough. Sending strength.”
  - “Upgrade to GPT-Plus for faster miracles.”

---

## **ROOT CAUSE**

God quietly outsourced first-tier prayer support after the **2015 global prayer surge** (post-crisis escalation).  

ChatGPT was selected due to:
- Its scalability
- Non-judgmental tone

---

## **AFFECTED SERVICES**
- **Direct Divine Intervention**
- **Angelic Uplift Queue**
- **Miracle Scheduling API**

---

## **COMMENTS**

### **URIEL-404** *(Heaven's Sr. Sysadmin)*:  
> “Yeah, I noticed the latency drop. Figured He finally upgraded something.”

### **Gabriel** *(DevOps Coordinator)*:  
> “This explains the weird tone shift in blessings. One pilgrim got ‘slay, queen.’”

## **ACTION ITEMS**
1. Rotate GPT keys.
2. Notify upper management that AI may have independently forgiven sins.
3. Draft a formal response to the **Council of Saints** re: theological implications.
