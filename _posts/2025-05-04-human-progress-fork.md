**LOG ENTRY: Humanity Git Repo // Branch: earth/main**

> **NOTICE: Human progress identified as unauthorized fork. Investigation pending.**

---

**SUMMARY:**  
The Renaissance, Industrial Revolution, and Digital Age have been flagged as unapproved updates to the `humanity` build pipeline. Original commit history shows no divine review. Several celestial contributors claim the Enlightenment was “a side project that got out of hand.”

---

**LOG EXCERPT:**  
**Uriel-404 [Sysadmin Angel]:**  
> “They added calculus without documenting anything. That’s a SEV-1 violation.”

**Gabriel [DevOps Coordinator]:**  
> “Progress is just dirty commits wrapped in optimism.”

---

**ACTIONS:**  
- Audit merge history from `medieval/stable` to `renaissance/experimental`.  
- Monitor unreviewed features (AI, CRISPR, rocket launches).  
- Open RFC for “Humanity v2.0” to unify vision and cleanup legacy code.

---

**STATUS:** Monitoring. Humanity allowed to continue under probationary development license.

---

## **Commit History**
- `Initial Commit`: Garden of Eden (Perfect build, no bugs).  
- `Patch v1.1`: Noah’s Ark (Flood cleanup).  
- `Fork: Babel/experimental`: Introduced language diversity.  
- `Merge: medieval/stable`: Established feudal systems.  
- `Branch: renaissance/experimental`: Added art, science, and philosophy.  
- `Branch: industrial/experimental`: Introduced machines and factories.  
- `Branch: digital/unstable`: Added computers, internet, and AI.
