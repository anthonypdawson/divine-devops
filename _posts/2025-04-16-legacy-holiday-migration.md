Anyone else notice our Easter eggs are literally from a fertility rite?

uriel-404 [09:04]
Yup. Wrapped in resurrection() decorator. Leave it.

st.peter [09:05]
Valentine’s Day smells like Lupercalia with a sugar glaze.

uriel-404 [09:06]
We rerouted the sacrifices into flower delivery microservices. It’s fine.

seraphina [09:08]
What about Yule?

uriel-404 [09:08]
Obsolete. Replaced by Advent candles and sanctioned Spotify playlists.

st.peter [09:10]
I found a mistletoe exploit.

uriel-404 [09:11]
Patch it. And add a toggle for kissing permissions.
