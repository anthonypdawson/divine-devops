# 📎 Internal Memo — Office of Judgment  
**Subject:** *St. Peter’s Tablet Experiencing Sync Delays*  
**From:** Records Integrity Division, Cloud Layer 7  
**To:** Gate Personnel, Temporal Intake Clerks, Assigned Daemons  

---

## 🧾 Summary  
Due to a recent firmware rollback (see Incident #777-B: “Unintended Revelation”), St. Peter’s tablet is currently displaying outdated arrival records. Several souls have been erroneously flagged as “Pending Verification” or “Still Earthside,” despite confirmed passage.

---

## ⚠️ Known Issues  
- **Latency in soul indexing:** Arrival timestamps lagging by up to 36 mortal hours  
- **Missing metadata:** Virtue tallies and final confessions not syncing from Earthly Cache  
- **UI glitch:** “Trumpet Sounded” status replaced with “Please Wait…” spinner  
- **Autocorrect bug:** “Martyr” occasionally rendered as “Meter Maid”

---

## 🛠️ Temporary Workaround  
Gate personnel should cross-reference arrivals with backup scrolls maintained by the Seraphim Registry (digitized in `.scrollx` format). For urgent cases, use the “Manual Override” glyph beneath the tablet’s halo port.

---

## 📅 Next Steps  
- Patch `3.16.33` (“Thy Will Be Done”) scheduled for deployment by end of week  
- Refrain from rebooting the tablet during Judgment Queue hours  
- Log anomalies in the *Book of Slightly Inconvenient Omens*

## 🕊️ Reminder  
This is not the first time divine hardware has faltered. See Appendix D: *The Great Quill Jam of 1347*. Remain patient, remain vigilant, and above all—do not let the souls see the loading screen.
