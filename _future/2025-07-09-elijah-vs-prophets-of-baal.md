# Elijah vs. Prophets of Baal: Cloud Provider Showdown

In the ancient days of DevOps, two rival cloud providers—**ElijahCloud** and **BaalStack**—competed for market dominance. Each claimed their deployment pipeline could summon fire to production with a single CLI command.

## The Challenge

- **BaalStack Devs**: Spent hours configuring YAML sacrifices, but their `baal deploy --fire` command failed with mysterious 504 Gateway Timeout errors. Their support tickets went unanswered, and the logs were full of cryptic warnings about "idol-ware dependencies."

- **ElijahCloud Devs**: After mocking their rivals, Elijah ran a single, faith-fueled command:

  ```sh
  elijahcloud deploy --fire --provider=heavenly
  ```

  Instantly, fire descended on the target environment. The deployment logs read:

  > [SUCCESS] Divine fire deployed. All resources consumed. No rollback required.

## Postmortem

- **Root Cause (BaalStack):**
  - Overengineered pipeline.
  - Idol-ware vendor lock-in.
  - Lack of observability and faith-based authentication.
- **Root Cause (ElijahCloud):**
  - Miraculous faith-driven deployment.
  - Zero trust, infinite faith.

## Lessons Learned

- Sometimes, the simplest pipeline—powered by faith and a clean CLI—is the most reliable.
- Avoid idol-ware and always check your cloud provider’s SLA with the divine.
