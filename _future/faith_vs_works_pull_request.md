```ts
Pull Request: Refactor Salvation Logic
Author: Paul-dev
Branch: faith-solo-auth

> Streamlines salvation pipeline via faith. Removes legacy works-based checks.

James-dev:
> But what about:

if (faith && !works) {
  throw new Error("FaithWithoutWorksException");
}

Uriel-404:
> Faith works in staging. Prod expects both. Merge doctrine.json first.

System Bot:
> Tests failed:
> - test_faith_alone_passes()
> - test_faith_without_works_crashes()

Jesus (codeOwner):
> "Love one another. That should cover it."
