### üßæ Executive Summary

Following an extensive audit, the Roman Spiritual Enforcement Commission (ROMSEC) has concluded its investigation into Yeshua of Nazareth for unauthorized theological disruption, failure to register messianic claims, and anticompetitive behavior within the Judean belief ecosystem.

The subject demonstrated monopolistic intent through:

- Bypassing sacrificial APIs via direct forgiveness commands (`forgive_sins(user)`),
- Offering free healing services without temple-sanctioned billing tokens,
- Refusing to comply with Pharisaic doctrinal licensing (Torah v1.0).

### üìâ Key Violations

| Code | Violation | Severity |
|------|-----------|----------|
| TEO-613(a) | Unlicensed miracle deployments | HIGH |
| REL-12(b) | Unauthorized claim to divinity | EXTREME |
| PRP-3(c) | Systemic disruption of priestly revenue model | SEVERE |
| GOV-7 | Inciting public version fork (‚ÄúKingdom of God‚Äù) | MAXIMUM |

### üßµ Case Summary

After multiple cease-and-desist scrolls were ignored, and a patch rollback (`Matt. 21:12`) failed to deter further system interference, local agents escalated the issue to the Judean Proconsul. Public sentiment was deemed volatile. A public crucifixion was recommended as a high-visibility deplatforming event.

Notably, post-execution audits revealed data resurrection 72 hours after incident close, possibly indicating backup persistence or unauthorized use of divine container snapshotting. An appeal is pending.

### üëº Commentary: Uriel-404, Compliance Angel

> _"Honestly, He wasn‚Äôt even charging. Just healing users for free. Rome called that 'market distortion.' They get real twitchy when salvation isn‚Äôt monetized."_  
>  
> _"We recommended a warning banner. Rome opted for wood and nails."_

### ‚öñÔ∏è Resolution

Yeshua of Nazareth has been flagged as a **theological monopolist** under ROMSEC guidelines. His movement remains under observation, though early followers have rebranded to "The Church" and continue to deploy unauthorized grace packets via decentralized prayer nodes.

We advise continued surveillance for:

- Resurrection exploits,
- Miraculous API tokens,
- Second Coming release candidates.

**<span class="bold-identifier">Appeal Status:</span>** Pending review by the Eternal Supreme Court (expected delay: ‚àû business days).
