## 🕰️ About Us  
Nestled between the **Celestial DMV** and the **Department of Lost Prophecies**, the **Office of Judgment** (also known as **The Directorate for Soul-Searching and Review of Existential Trajectories (DSSRET)**) is the afterlife’s least glamorous agency. We don’t smite. We don’t sing. We *audit*.

> “All audits are final. Appeals may be filed in triplicate and will be ignored in the order received.”

Our mission? To evaluate the moral ledger of every soul that passes through the veil. Not with flaming swords or divine visions—but with spreadsheets, incident reports, and a suspicious number of sticky notes.

## 🧑‍💼 Meet the Team  
- **Barb, Judgment Analyst #342-B**  
  Senior auditor. Wields a quill like a scalpel. Has personally flagged over 12,000 souls for `excessive smugness`.

- **Kyle, Intern Cherub**  
  New. Eager. Accidentally approved a hedge fund manager for `sainthood`. We’re still cleaning up the karmic fallout.

- **Gregg, Daemon Liaison**  
  From **Hell’s HR**. Technically here to ensure `fair representation`. Mostly drinks coffee and files grievances about the temperature of the coffee.

## 🗃️ What We Do  
Every soul gets a file. Every file gets a verdict.  
Sometimes it’s simple. Sometimes it’s a 47-page PDF with footnotes and a divine appendix.

We cross-reference `sins`, `virtues`, and `questionable life choices`.    
We consult the Sacred Tablet (currently running `JudgmentOS v3.1`).   
We argue. We sigh. We send souls to their final destinations with all the enthusiasm of a *middle manager* approving PTO.

But if you’ve ever wondered what happens behind the pearly cubicles—this is your glimpse.

Expect leaked memos, incident reports, and occasional divine glitches.  
Expect the bureaucracy. Expect the snark. Expect the petty. Expect *Barb*.
