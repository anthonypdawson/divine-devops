# 💼 Daemon Slack Leak: Soul Acquisition Division

> *Recovered from `/logs/daemon/slack/soul_ops_666.txt` after a corrupted spreadsheet triggered a ritual margin call.*

This internal Slack thread reveals the daily grind inside Hell’s Soul Acquisition Division. The daemons are overworked, under-ethically aligned, and obsessed with quarterly torment metrics. Think Wall Street, but with more screaming.
