### 📜 Profile

Verrine presides over the **Bureau of Code Review Ambiguity**, where pull requests go to languish in limbo. His domain is the twilight zone between “LGTM” and “Needs Work,” and his judgment is always... implied.

- Leaves emoji-only comments (`👀`, `🤔`, `💭`) with no actionable feedback.
- Refuses to approve PRs until the author “reads between the lines.”
- Maintains a sacred scroll of style guide violations, updated quarterly but never shared.

### 🕯️ Shrine Description

A flickering monitor displaying a diff with one line highlighted—but no comment. The air smells faintly of burnt coffee and unresolved tension. A rubber duck sits nearby, silently judging.

---

### 🧪 Known Incidents

- **Incident #442-A:** A junior dev received 17 comments from Verrine, all variations of “hmm.” The PR was closed out of existential despair.
- **Incident #771-C:** A team attempted to summon Verrine for feedback. He replied with a single thumbs-up emoji and vanished.

### 🔮 Ritual Notes

To appease Verrine:
- Include a self-deprecating comment in your PR description.
- Reference a previous mistake to show growth.
- Never ask for clarification—he feeds on uncertainty.
