### üß® Description:
Asmodeus, daemon of chaotic hotfixes, is invoked whenever a developer is tempted to "just patch it in production." He delights in last-minute changes, unreviewed commits, and the irresistible urge to refactor everything during a critical incident.

Once a guardian of orderly releases, Asmodeus fell from grace after merging a 2,000-line hotfix directly to `main` at 3:00 AM. He now haunts CI/CD pipelines, whispering, "It'll be fine, just push it."

He is the whisperer of "it works on my machine," the sower of merge conflicts, and the architect of the midnight rollback. Where order reigns, Asmodeus sows chaos with TODOs, quick fixes, and the promise of "we'll clean it up later."

---


### üõ†Ô∏è Manifestations:
- Hotfixes deployed directly to production
- Refactors started during outages
- Unreviewed PRs merged under duress
- "Temporary" code that becomes permanent
- Comments like `// TODO: fix this later`
- Feature flags toggled without documentation
- Rollbacks that break more than they fix

---


### üïØÔ∏è Summoning Signs:
- Pager alerts at 2am
- A Slack thread titled "Quick fix, no review needed"
- A sudden urge to rewrite the auth system during a live incident
- The phrase "we'll clean it up after the deploy"
- A mysterious branch named `hotfix/final-final-v2`

---


**Confirmed Ritual:**
```bash
ssh prod-server
nano app.js
# frantically patch code
pm2 restart all
# pray to the daemon of uptime
```

### üìù Case Study: The Night of the Infinite Hotfix

**Incident:**  
On the eve of a major launch, the production server began to fail. Asmodeus was summoned when a developer, under pressure, patched a critical bug live‚Äîwithout review or tests. The fix worked... until it triggered a cascade of new errors, each requiring another "quick" patch. By dawn, the codebase was a labyrinth of TODOs and commented-out lines.

**Resolution:**  
A full rollback, followed by a week of code archaeology and a new team policy: "No hotfixes after midnight."

*Beware Asmodeus, for his fixes are swift, but his bugs are eternal.*
