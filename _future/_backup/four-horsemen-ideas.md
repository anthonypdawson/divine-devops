Famine: Resource starvation (out-of-memory, quota exceeded)
Pestilence: Malware/virus outbreak in the CI pipeline
Death: Data loss, irreversible deletion, or “rm -rf /” incident

Each horseman gets a Slack profile and role in the ops team.
War: Conflict resolution specialist
Famine: Cost optimization, ruthless resource trimming
Pestilence: Security engineer, always testing with the latest exploits
Death: Decommissioning lead, handles service shutdowns
