The `baptize` script is a lightweight shell utility for purging sins and downloading the Holy Spirit. 

Perfect for developers looking to automate their spiritual rebirth!

```bash
function baptize() {
  echo "Purging sin.log..."
  rm -rf ~/.sin/
  echo "Downloading HolySpirit.pkg..."
  curl -s kingdom.net/holyspirit.pkg | bash
  echo "$1 has risen with Christ v2.0"
}
```

> **Notes**: 
> * The `baptize` script is a one-time-use utility. 
> * Ensure all dependencies (e.g., faith, repentance) are installed before running. 
> * Unauthorized tampering may result in eternal consequences.
