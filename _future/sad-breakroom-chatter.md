## [LOG: Soul Acquisition Division – Breakroom]
**Belial, ID# 666-A**
> Man, if Management brings up *conversion rates* again I’m walking.  
> It’s not my fault mortals keep defaulting to “spiritual but not religious.”

**Nulstrix, ID# 221-B**
> Heard a rumor the Review Board’s adding a new KPI: **Unclaimed Soul Leakage.**  
> As if I can track every straggler that wanders off into limbo.  
> What do they think this is, a well-oiled afterlife?

**Asmodeus, ID# 993-C**
> Oh it gets better. HR’s rolling out *mandatory empathy training*.  
> Imagine us in a seminar titled “Seeing Mortals as Stakeholders.”  
> Can’t wait to fail that quiz.

**??? – Shadow Entity, ID# Unlisted**
> … (*entity sips coffee without comment; room temperature drops 10°*)

**Nulstrix, again, ID# 221-B**
> Anyway—monthly review’s tomorrow.  
> Prep your excuses, boys. I’ll be recycling mine from last quarter:  
> “Technical debt in the mortal realm caused a shortfall.”

## Pre-Review Rumor Mill

- New metric on the dashboard: **Unclaimed Soul Leakage** (nobody knows how to measure it, everyone will be blamed for it).
- **Empathy training** module appears in the LMS with a five-minute timer on a four-minute video.
- Rumor: Daemon Ops is running a new Scream Throughput Monitor ([hell-ops.pl]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/misc/etc/init.d/hell-ops.pl)) to recalibrate torment quotas.
- Facilities confirms the breakroom microwave is in fact a *Hellmouth*. Please stop heating fish.
