`“Let there be light… monitoring.” — Genesis Debug Log, v1.0`

# HeavenOps Glyph Roster
**Team: Celestial DevOps Platform** — *Lead: Archangel Michael*

Welcome to the official HeavenOps Glyph Roster—a classified log of the angels assigned to the Celestial DevOps Platform. Each member brings a unique blend of mythological gravitas and technical prowess, ensuring uptime, security, and the occasional miracle. If you spot a deployment anomaly, rest assured: it’s probably intentional (or a feature).

**Key Roles at a Glance:**
- 🧑‍💻 Raphael: Merge Angel & Bug Healer
- 🔥 Uriel: Deployment Architect
- 📦 Gabriel: CI/CD Prophet
- 🗂️ Michael: IAM Overlord
- 🌩️ Metatron: Stack Trace Translator
- 🧙‍♂️ Rasputin: Rogue Debugger
- 🐍 The Serpent: Chaos Agent (Revoked)
- 🎶 Sandalphon: Release Manager
- 🥧 Zadkiel: Incident Response
- ⚰️ Azrael: Legacy Decommissioner
- 👁️ Remiel: Monitoring Angel
- 🎨 Haniel: UX Evangelist
- ☁️ Ariel: Cloud Guardian
- 👶 Intern Cherub: Wildcard/Intern

> **Celestial Trivia:**
> - The HeavenOps team once achieved 100% uptime during a leap year, but only after a divine intervention.
> - Intern Cherub is still learning YAML, but already has more certifications than most mortals.
> - The Serpent’s access was revoked after a forbidden commit that introduced recursion into the Book of Genesis.
