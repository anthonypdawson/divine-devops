**> INCIDENT REPORT: INFANT CODE REVIEW - INITIATION CYCLE 0001**

**Context:**  
Three external consultants arrived on-site to evaluate the prototype Messiah module. Their robes indicate seniority; their expense reports suggest unchecked confidence.

---

**> Consultant 1: Balthazar (Gold - Performance & Stability)**  
```
# performance.test
assert messiah.uptime >= eternity
assert miracles.latency <= 3s
assert load_balancer (loaves, fishes) == infinite_scale
```
**Notes:** Code is optimized for stress-handling and multitudes. Recommend adding autoscaling logic for Sermon-on-the-Mount-tier traffic spikes.

---

**> Consultant 2: Melchior (Frankincense - User Experience)**  
```
# user_experience.audit
assert parables.format == accessible
assert messaging.clarity >= 95%
assert empathy.core_module == True
```
**Notes:** Excellent UX design. Users will find teachings intuitive. Slightly cryptic responses logged—suggest async parable decoder patch.

---

**> Consultant 3: Caspar (Myrrh - Maintenance & Debugging)**  
```
# resurrection.protocol
assert death_event == recoverable
assert tomb_exit_sequence == clean_shutdown
assert post_resurrection_logs == immutable
```
**Notes:** Impressive fault tolerance. Pre-installed resurrection handler appears functional. Long-term logs suggest martyrdom subroutine—needs soft deprecation strategy.

---

**> Final Verdict:**  
Approved for public beta. Launch deferred until age 30 milestone. Gifts delivered as symbolic install packages. Consultant retainer extended through Epiphany.

**// End Report**
