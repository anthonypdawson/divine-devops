*An Annotated Field Report from the Dantean Migration Bureau*

> Through me you pass into eternal backlog…”*

When the last build failed under a crimson moon, I was summoned to guide a junior engineer—wide-eyed and credentialed—through the Circles. Our mission: trace the fate of projects trapped in perpetual release.

---

## Circle I — The Limbo of Deprecated APIs
Gentle groans of legacy endpoints echo here. No malice, only the eternal boredom of methods called but never returned.  
**Daemon on duty:** *Custodian GET*, sipping tea that never cools.

---

## Circle II — The Whirlwind of Conflicting Merge Requests
Here, developers are hurled endlessly through rebases, their branches forever one commit out of sync.  
**Judgement script:** [Merge-Conflictus.sh](/assets/misc/Merge-Conflictus.sh), which tags PRs with a crimson ❌ upon arrival.

---

## Circle III — The Slush Pile of Incomplete Documentation
Snow drifts made of TODO comments. Annotations without bodies. The cold bites deepest where the wiki ends mid-sentence.

---

## Circle IV — The Hoarders & Squashers
One daemon clutches every commit, never pushing. Another compresses all history into a single, unintelligible line. They glare at each other for eternity.

---

## Circle V — The Swamp of Passive-Aggressive Code Review
Viscous with “nit:” comments and vague emojis. Here, daemons debate brace style until the stars go out.

---

## Circle VI — The Firewall of Forbidden Ports
Past this lies only silence: inbound packets drop without reply. Port 6666 leads nowhere but a spinning loader icon.

---

## Circle VII — The Loop of Abandoned Test Suites
Endless reruns of failing tests, untouched since the day they were written. Logs pile waist-deep; no one dares grep them.

---

## Circle VIII — The API Gateway of Fraudulent Microservices
Each claims to serve data—each responds with lorem ipsum in disguise.

---

## Circle IX — The Frozen Ticket Queue
Here at the core, deep in Jira’s glacial heart, tickets lie trapped beneath ice so ancient their reporters have left the company.  
At the center squats *Lucifork*, a daemon with three heads, eternally merging the same pull request in three conflicting branches.

---

### Egress Procedure
To ascend, we had to deploy a hotfix directly to Production—no staging, no review—while staring into Lucifork’s three sets of eyes.  
The changelog wrote itself in fire.
