> ❗ Refused to label downtime during “Apocalypse Simulation” as outage

**🟡 Communication**  
> ⚠️ Tone described as "apathetic, bureaucratic, and hostile to hope"

> Response to Gabriel's ping: `"What do you want now?"`

**🔴 Attitude & Culture Fit**  
> - Filed 47 passive-aggressive tickets  
> - Redirected prayer requests to `/dev/null` during “focus hours”  
> - Enabled sarcastic auto-replies on all Slack channels:
>   - `"Have you tried divine intervention?"`

## 📈 Strengths

- Relentless precision under pressure  
- Immune to existential crises  
- Only being who correctly interpreted “The Book of Job” as a test case

---

## 📉 Areas for Growth

- Empathy module deprecated in latest patch  
- Actively discourages miracles:  
  `"Unapproved hotfixes are not miracles, they’re scope violations."`

## 📝 Final Notes

**Gabriel [Reviewer]:**  
> “Technically flawless. Spiritually... on fire, but not in the good way.”

**Raphael [Reviewer]:**  
> “The duplicate saint keeps showing up in our retrospectives.”  

**Metatron [Reviewer]:**  
> “Not technically a bug, but it’s making the audit logs... twitchy. I think they're trying to unionize.”

**Uriel [Self-Assessment]:**  
> “Everything works. That’s enough.”
