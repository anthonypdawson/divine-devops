## ⚠️ Incident Report: Divine Service Decommissioned

**Timestamp:** 1882 CE  
**Location:** Philosophical Stack Overflow  
**Reported By:** F. Nietzsche (rogue contributor)

### 🎯 Summary

System audit reveals abrupt termination of `god_instance`, previously maintained under DivineOps LTS. Event classified as a Cosmic P1 outage. No rollback initiated. Ethical frameworks destabilizing across distributed human nodes.

---

### 🛠️ Root Cause Analysis

- Unauthorized commit: `kill(god_instance)`  
- Philosophical override of moral dependency tree  
- Security logs flagged “faith” module as deprecated  
- Backup deity binaries corrupted: no fallback available

---

### 📈 Impact Radius

- Moral compass cluster drift detected  
- Afterlife routing protocols rerouted to `/dev/null`  
- Local prophets initiated forked service “GaaS” (God-as-a-Service)  
- Uptime mythos replaced by existential exception handling

---

### 🧪 Proposed Fixes

- Patch reality kernel with empathy middleware  
- Deploy decentralized spiritual container system  
- Enable multi-faith Kubernetes for legacy soul orchestration  
- Refactor meaning-of-life syntax to accept null values

### 🎭 Commentary

The DevOps of divinity face their biggest PR crisis yet. Stakeholder faith wavering. Ontological SLA breached. How will HeavenOps address a platform outage that questions the existence of the platform itself?
