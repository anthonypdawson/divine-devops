# Incident Management in HeavenOps

Even celestial systems aren’t immune to unexpected failures. When divine interventions misfire, **HeavenOps** follows strict incident protocols to contain the fallout and restore faith stability.

## 📍 Example: Mass Prayer Queues Overload

**Incident:** Millions simultaneously petition for **sports victories**, overloading the **Prayer Processing Node** and causing widespread latency in miracle responses.

### 🔍 Root Cause Analysis:
- **Failure Point:** The **Petition Load Balancer** failed to distribute faith requests effectively.
- **Contributing Factors:** Several archangels manually rerouted priority requests, causing theological deadlocks.

### ⚡ Incident Response Protocol (`faith-failover.yml`):
1. **Immediate Containment:** Redirect all non-urgent prayers to **Deferred Miracles Processing** (`miracle-backlog.md`).
2. **Mitigation:** Spin up additional **Ethereal Kubernetes Pods** to handle priority interventions.
3. **Resolution:** Adjust **miracle request prioritization algorithms** to prevent overcommitment on low-impact blessings (e.g., avoiding multiple miracles for the same sports match).

### 📜 Postmortem & Lessons Learned:
- **Avoid manual overrides**—angelic interference in automated prayer routing introduces uncertainty.
- **Improve documentation clarity**—apostles need clearer guidelines on acceptable miracle escalation procedures.
- **Optimize Faith Quota Balancing**—ensure divine throughput remains stable during peak petition periods.
