# 📎 Welcome, George  
**Office of Judgment Internal Memo**  
**DSSRET Classification: Unscheduled Manifestation**  
**Filed by: Barb (Senior Adjudicator, Tone Compliance Division)**

Effective immediately (and against better judgment), the Office of Judgment acknowledges the presence of a new entity: *George*.   

No surname. No credentials. No onboarding scroll.    


He simply appeared—mid-review, mid-sentence—correcting a tribunal memo with the phrase *“This is nonsense, and you know it.”*

## 🧍 Profile Summary  
- **Name**: George  
- **Role**: Undefined. Possibly Auditor. Possibly Saboteur.  
- **Desk**: Folding chair near the vending machine  
- **Aura**: Mildly disruptive. Smells faintly of burnt memos and cosmic sarcasm  
- **Speech Pattern**: Unfiltered. Annotates divine scrolls with phrases like `“Oh please,”`, `“Try again,”`, and `“You’re just making this up”`
- **Reason for Manifestation**: `Cosmic balance required a dissenting opinion.`

## 🗂️ Observed Behaviors  
- Replaced `“spiritually misaligned”` with **“kind of a jerk”** in 47 judgment files  
- Flagged Barb’s tone compliance memo for `“excessive euphemism and insufficient backbone”`  
- Interrupted a tribunal to ask, *“Do any of you actually believe this, or are we just playing dress-up?”*

> "Look, I'm not saying the system is flawed. I'm saying it's a ridiculous, overwrought, and fundamentally arbitrary system of cosmic nitpicking, and Barb knows it."

## 📜 Directive  
Until further notice, George is to be tolerated.

He may not be divine, but he is undeniably correct.

Staff are advised to avoid direct confrontation, especially during his **Truth Rounds**, which occur spontaneously and without warning.

---

## 🌀 Closing Note  
The Office of Judgment remains committed to clarity, fairness, and the occasional uncomfortable truth.

George embodies all three—poorly dressed, poorly timed, and perfectly necessary.
