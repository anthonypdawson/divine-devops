# 🛶 HeavenOps Incident Report #043
## Noah's Ark UAT Failure: The Great Regression Flood

**Incident ID**: `HVNOPS-2347-043`  
**Severity**: P0 - Catastrophic (Global Data Loss)  
**Date**: ~2347 BCE  
**Duration**: 40 days (plus post-flood cleanup)  
**Affected Systems**: Earth-prod, Animal DB, Ark Container  
**Status**: ✅ Resolved (with permanent rollback)

---

## Executive Summary

A failed User Acceptance Test (UAT) for the Ark deployment resulted in a global regression flood, wiping out all non-ark data and requiring a full rollback to Genesis-main. QA protocols were updated to include waterproofing and animal pair validation.

> **TL;DR**: The test environment was not isolated. The rollback was biblical.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Cause
**QA Oversight**: Noah merged the Ark branch without isolating the test environment, resulting in a global flood regression.

### Contributing Factors
1. **Schema Drift**: Animal DB contained duplicate unicorn entries
2. **Insufficient Waterproofing**: Ark container failed water ingress tests
3. **Poor Documentation**: No rollback plan for aquatic mammals
4. **Unvalidated Pairs**: QA missed several non-compliant animal pairs

---

## Evidence Recovered

- 🦄 **Unicorn DB fragments** (corrupted)
- 🐍 **Snake pair audit logs** (missing one snake)
- 🐘 **Elephant waterproofing test results** (failed)
- 🦆 **Duck migration scripts** (still running)

## Known Issues

- 🕊️ **Dove keeps timing out on branch requests** (still fetching olive branch after 40 days)
- 🌈 **Rainbow deployment still pending** (waiting for post-flood conditions)
- 🦆 **Duck migration scripts** (still running, consuming excessive resources)
- 🐍 **Snake authentication** (still experiencing infinite slithering loops)

---

## Lessons Learned
- Always isolate the test environment before UAT
- Validate animal pairs and waterproofing
- Document rollback plans for all species
- Unicorns remain unsupported in production

---

## Post-Incident Review

**Action Items:**
- All future arks must pass swim tests in staging environment first
- Implement mandatory animal pair validation hooks
- Add waterproofing to standard container requirements
- Backup all mythical creatures before major deployments
