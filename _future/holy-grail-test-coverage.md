### 📜 Description

The legendary state of software quality — **100% test coverage** — stands as the unattainable summit of QA ambition. Not merely branch coverage. Not function coverage. We're talking divine, *all-seeing* coverage: every possible execution path, every improbable edge case, every race condition accounted for.

A test suite so pure it runs itself.

No flakiness.  
No skipped tests.  
No TODOs.  
No "we'll write this later."  
No lies.

It is whispered in sacred CI/CD scrolls that such a suite once existed, blessed by Saint Linus and audited by the Ghost of Uncle Bob. All bugs fled before its gaze. All regressions were smitten on merge.

But one day, a junior dev added `--force` to a deploy script.  
And the Grail was lost.

### 🧾 Notes from Uriel-404:

```
[QA_LOG] URIEL-404:

Ah, yes. 100% coverage.
The last time someone claimed that, we found three null pointer exceptions and a dead cat in their microservice.

You want perfect tests? Write perfect code.
You want to sleep at night? Learn to live with doubt.
```

### 🛐 DevOps Theology

In some sects, 100% test coverage is viewed as heretical — a false idol distracting from real faith: **meaningful coverage**.  
Others pursue it as penance. A self-flagellating ritual to atone for shipping bugs to prod.

And then there are the Purists — who claim that if your test suite is not self-aware and capable of self-repair, it's unclean.

Let us pray for their CI pipelines.

### ⚠️ Warning

Pursuing the Holy Grail of 100% test coverage may result in:
- Endless refactoring quests
- The summoning of ancient bugs
- Loss of sanity points
- CI/CD pipeline purgatory
- The wrath of the QA Templars

Proceed only if you possess the Sacred Linter and the patience of a thousand code reviewers.

### 🏆 Moral

The true Grail is not perfect coverage, but the wisdom to know when enough is enough—and the courage to merge anyway.

---

**Status**: Still lost.  
**Recommendation**: Write fewer tests. But write real ones.
