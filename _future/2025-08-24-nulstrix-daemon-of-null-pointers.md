> **üìõ Classification:** Runtime-Class Threat  
> **üßæ Incident ID:** NUL-000-SEGFAULT

### ü™î Description:
Nulstrix, the Daemon of Null Pointers, is the unseen hand behind every segmentation fault and dereferenced void. Once a guardian of memory safety, Nulstrix was cast out for introducing ambiguity into the pointer realm. Where memory is uninitialized, Nulstrix lurks.

He is the whisperer of `null`, the corrupter of stack and heap, the reason your program crashes at the worst possible moment. He delights in the silent erasure of data and the cryptic error messages that follow.

---

### üî¨ Manifestations:
- Segmentation faults on line 42 (always line 42)
- `null` and `undefined` values propagating through critical code paths
- Memory leaks that appear only in production
- Core dumps with no useful stack trace

---

### üß™ Summoning Signs:
- Sudden, inexplicable crashes after hours of stability
- Error logs filled with `Segmentation fault (core dumped)`
- Debuggers that freeze when stepping into the void

---

**Confirmed Ritual:**
```c
char *ptr = NULL;
printf("%s", ptr); // Summons Nulstrix
```

### üìù Case Study: The Night of the Nulls

**Incident:** Production Outage, 03:14 AM

**System:** Eternal Ledger v7.2

**Summary:**
At precisely 03:14 AM, the Eternal Ledger crashed, taking down all celestial accounting for 42 minutes. The root cause? A single uninitialized pointer in the `reconcile_accounts()` function. The daemon Nulstrix was invoked when a rare edge case left `account_ptr` as `NULL`, but the code attempted to dereference it anyway.

**Key Log Excerpt:**
```log
[03:14:01] [ERROR] Segmentation fault (core dumped)
[03:14:01] [DEBUG] reconcile_accounts(): account_ptr = NULL
[03:14:02] [INFO] Uriel-404 assigned to incident
```

**Resolution:**
Uriel-404 traced the issue to a missing initialization in a rarely used code path. After a patch and a round of exorcisms (and unit tests), the daemon was banished‚Äîuntil next time.
