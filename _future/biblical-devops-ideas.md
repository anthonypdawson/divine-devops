### Old Testament

- **Elijah vs. Prophets of Baal**  
  Competing cloud providers. Devs call down fire via CLI to prove deployment supremacy.

- **David and Goliath**  
  A tiny microservice (David) defeats a bloated monolithic system (Goliath) with a precision exploit.

- **Solomon**  
  The AI wisdom oracle who splits requests with deterministic logic. Handles two users claiming the same child process.

- **Noah’s Ark**  
  Disaster recovery plan and Zoo-as-a-Service provisioning pipeline. Full-scale backup of ecosystem.

- **The Golden Calf**  
  Users sideload third-party idol-ware while God is AFK compiling commandments.

- **Tower of Babel**  
  CI/CD language fork. Protocol confusion and incompatible syntax split the dev team.
