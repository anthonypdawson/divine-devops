> **TYPE:** Uncontrolled biological malware spread  
> **CAUSE:** Misconfigured population control script

## **CONSOLE LOG:**  
**Uriel-404:**

**Michael [Security]:**  
> “We traced the call to a disgruntled archangel with root access and a grudge.”

## **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**

- **Misconfigured Script**: The function `thin_population(beta=true)` was deployed to production without proper testing.
- **Privilege Escalation**: A disgruntled archangel exploited root access to bypass deployment safeguards.
- **Lack of Rollback Plan**: The script lacked a rollback mechanism, leading to uncontrolled spread.

## **ACTIONS TAKEN:**  
- [x] Revoked all deployment permissions from angels below Cherubim level.  
- [x] Locked `plague_scripts/` behind an AI ethics review board.  
- [x] Logged incident as part of the “Eternal Audit Trail.”
