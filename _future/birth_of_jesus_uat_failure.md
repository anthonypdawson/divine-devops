# INCIDENT REPORT

**Timestamp:** `[REDACTED]`  
**Component:** `MessiahDeploymentPipeline`  
**Severity:** `Medium`  
**Status:** `Partial Pass - Deviation Logged`

---

## DESCRIPTION

During the final User Acceptance Testing (UAT) phase for the **Messiah Deployment Project**, deviations were detected against the **prophetic specifications** outlined in `/requirements/old_testament/specs.yml`.

Specifically, the **Birth Location Module** did not align with expected prophecy criteria.  
Instead of a clean deployment to a **registered Bethlehem hotel**, the live environment redirected to a **low-availability stable** due to unexpected accommodation failures.

## ERROR LOG EXCERPTS

```yaml
[UAT Runner Log - 00:14 UTC]

INFO: Checking location...
EXPECTED: "Bethlehem - Premium Suite"
ACTUAL: "Bethlehem - Livestock Shelter"
STATUS: Warning - Soft fail accepted under prophecy flexibility clause

INFO: Checking parental lineage...
RESULT: Pass

WARNING: Low hygiene scores detected in environment.
NOTE: Adjusting prophecy tolerance threshold.
```

```bash
# Deployment fallback output
[INFANT_DEPLOY.sh]

if [ "$no_vacancy" == "true" ]; then
    echo "Fallback to stable environment."
    deploy_location="/bethlehem/stable_001"
fi
```

---

## ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

- **Overbooking Issue:** Accommodation subsystem failed to reserve room ahead of holiday surge.
- **Fallback Policy:** Graceful degradation protocols redirected birth event to stable.
- **Prophetic Error Margin:** Divine specifications allowed Â±5% flexibility in live conditions.

---

## COMMENTS

**URIEL-404** (Sr. Sysadmin):  
> "Frankly, stable deployment is better than no deployment. I call that a win."

**Gabriel** (DevOps Coordinator):  
> "Next time, let's pre-book with at least a 90-day buffer window. Holiday traffic is brutal."

**AuditBot.v3:**  
> `INFO: Minor prophecy deviation tolerated. Overall faith alignment remains intact.`

---

## ACTION ITEMS

- [x] Document stable fallback as valid prophecy fulfillment case.
- [ ] Review accommodation reservation protocols for future critical births.
- [ ] Push patch update to prophecy verification engine to handle environmental variances.
- [ ] Issue official post-incident prophecy reconciliation memo.

---

## ADDITIONAL NOTES

- Incident classified as **"miracle resilience"**.
- Overall Messiah project marked **launched and operational** despite environment quirks.
