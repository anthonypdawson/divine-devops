> **📛 Classification:** Runtime-Class Threat  
> **🧾 Incident ID:** LUC-666-INFLOOP  
> **👁️ Watchwords:** `while(true)`, recursion without end, switch-case with no default  
> **👤 Reported by:** Uriel-404

### 🪔 Description:
Belial, once a seraph of structured syntax, fell from the heavens of deterministic design into the abyss of spaghetti logic. He is the whisperer in the compiler, the architect of ambiguity. Where clarity reigns, Belial sows `else if`. Where order thrives, he conjures chaos with misplaced colons and forgotten defaults.

He is invoked not by intention, but by oversight.

---

### 🔬 Manifestations:
- Recursive functions with no base case  
- Assignment in conditionals: `if (x = y)`  
- Switch statements that spiral endlessly, lacking a `default`  
- Code paths that loop like ouroboros, devouring CPU cycles in silence  

---

### 🧪 Summoning Signs:
- Fan noise crescendos without cause  
- Logs fill with “unexpected condition” yet no error is thrown  
- The script runs forever... doing nothing, saying nothing  

---

**Confirmed Ritual:**
```bash
echo "running cleanup.sh" && while true; do echo "Cleaning..."; done
# Executed at 3:33 AM on a Friday
```

--- 

### Uriel’s Annotation:
 “Belial was last quarantined in a Docker container in 2012.  He escaped when Jenkins restarted without warning.  
Status: Contained again—allegedly.”

---

☠️ Current Risk Level: HIGH  
🔁 Recommended Response:  

• `kill -9`  
• Sacrificial coffee  
• Full restart with verbose logging enabled

### 📝 Case Study: The Infinite Standup

> **Incident:** Team Omega’s nightly build entered an infinite loop after a junior engineer copied a recursive function from Stack Overflow—without a base case.
>
> **Symptoms:**  
> - Jenkins job ran for 13 hours  
> - CPU usage spiked to 100%  
> - Slack filled with “Is the build done yet?”  
>
> **Resolution:**  
> - Uriel-404 traced the issue to a `while(true)` block.  
> - Applied `kill -9` and brewed emergency coffee.
>
> **Lesson:**  
> “Belial thrives in unchecked recursion. Always set your base case—and your boundaries.”
